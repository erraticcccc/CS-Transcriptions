1
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,522
Alright, glad to have you back,

2
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:27,779
and immediately, we are moving
 to something else entirely.

3
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,380
Something completely new. It's a new level.

4
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,490
Now, first of all, as a rule of
thumb for this new level,

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
when you go for a matador,
they get behind you.

6
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:39,824
And it sort of fools you into
thinking that you can get it.

7
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:41,925
You go right, left, not get it.

8
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:43,949
You go left, they still get to your side.

9
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,550
You see, your reflex as spy tells you that,

10
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,951
from a certain distance,
once you change directions,

11
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:51,952
you can get behind somebody.

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,760
But that just doesn't happen here,

13
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:56,386
it just stops.

14
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,887
So once you figure that
matadors don't work,

15
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,493
you go for a circle strafes,

16
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,794
and your relfex while circlestrafing

17
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,325
is telling you that something

18
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:05,926
like this is going to happen.

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,950
But then you go and you try it

20
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:09,823
on some people and...

21
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:14,927
Let's try this again,

22
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:17,301
just like this and...

23
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:20,992
He's supposed to strafe into me, isn't he?

24
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:24,563
Screw it! Let's just go back
to that medic again.

25
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:25,965
Let's just...

26
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:27,468
Almost got him!

27
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,070
He sorta just, backed away.

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,343
But wait...

29
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:34,143
He shanks and backs away,

30
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:36,101
isn't he supposed to back up into me

31
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:38,352
as long as I'm circle strafing?

32
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,170
What

33
00:01:39,873 --> 00:01:41,097
is happening?

34
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:44,146
So, once you figure out matadors don't work

35
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,621
and circlestrafes don't work,

36
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,906
you just start using both randomly.

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,416
First a matador,

38
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,325
then a circlestrafe.

39
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:53,737
And you keep thinking that
you are going to get it

40
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:56,143
right before before you fail and die.

41
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,756
There are two scenarios:

42
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:00,071
one is that you don't
collide with them at all,

43
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:02,232
and the other is that they get behind you

44
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,256
if you decide to change directions

45
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,783
and go for a matador.

46
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,863
They sorta just keep running after you

47
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:10,541
but then at the last moment,

48
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,213
they get to your side.

49
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,559
So you try to time it so that

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,631
you get in front of them, but

51
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,755
that doesn't work either.

52
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,701
And all of that, while your reflex,

53
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:21,894
your innate reflex as spy,

54
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:23,895
is telling you that you
are going to get them.

55
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:26,801
So you think to yourself:

56
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:28,359
ok, good players

57
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:30,274
don't fall for trickstabs.

58
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:32,061
But this is hardly the case.

59
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:33,213
It's just that,

60
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:36,576
so far, you were just randomly

61
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,444
throwing what you can do at them.

62
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:40,202
It's not that they're better,

63
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:42,141
or any good at all. It's just that

64
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,644
they're moving in a way

65
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,603
that your movement doesn't counter.

66
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,657
The point of circlestrafing is

67
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:49,808
matching your movement

68
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:50,693
to another's.

69
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,342
It's only when you understand this

70
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,804
that you can start getting things done.

71
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:57,067
And damn,

72
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,673
I really learnt this the hard way.

73
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:04,214
Now, when I put all
these clips here together,

74
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,541
and lump them all together

75
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,639
for you to see,

76
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:08,718
it's easy to understand what's happening.

77
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,281
But these videos

78
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:12,795
used to be just very theoretical,

79
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:14,647
because I kept finding holes in it.

80
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:17,612
People who moved in ways that
I could not understand.

81
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,159
And it was because of the guys

82
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:22,164
on this next level of strafing.

83
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,444
This is the fourth level of strafing:

84
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:26,183
STRAFING AWAY

85
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:30,519
People who are strafing away are,

86
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,654
to put it simply, people who are trying

87
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:33,703
to get around you.

88
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,727
And you can get them with a stab that

89
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:36,947
consists of going

90
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:38,703
forwards and backwards.

91
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:40,845
It's the level 4 stab.

92
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,942
Essentially, this is what
you are doing to them.

93
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,956
But it gets a lot more
complicated than just that,

94
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,354
a hell of a lot more complicated...

95
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,144
So, let's get started.

96
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:56,751
Now, if they are not already trying

97
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:57,789
to get around you,

98
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,794
from the side, like that guy.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,818
What you wanna do while fighting them

100
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:03,646
is to open up the space

101
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,287
for them to go around you.

102
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,432
Here I strafe over to the right

103
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,456
and give him the space to strafe

104
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,088
around me from the left.

105
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:13,520
And I want you to remember this arrow.

106
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:15,835
I want you to get used to the idea

107
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:18,126
of people going around you like this.

108
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,605
Again here, I strafe to one side

109
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,629
to open it up for him

110
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,088
to go for the other.

111
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:25,369
See where he looked?

112
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,296
Get used to the idea

113
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:29,550
of him turning while going around you.

114
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:32,713
Now, while you do this stab, sometimes

115
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,483
the guy will fly forwards,

116
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,686
making it look kinda like a matador.

117
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:39,244
It happens because he held W

118
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,980
 by accident at the last second.

119
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,485
But, most of the time,

120
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:44,180
people will gravitate backwards,

121
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:45,834
because they are not going after you.

122
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:48,163
They are trying to get to
the space behind you.

123
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,187
They're not trying to hit you in the back,

124
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,342
they're trying to be careful.

125
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:53,114
That's why the stab can extend into

126
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:55,956
a backpedal stab, when you
move back with them.

127
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,219
Now, because people don't actually want

128
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,683
to get anywhere near you while doing this,

129
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,251
they're gonna take wider
circles around you,

130
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:05,275
meaning that you're going to have to

131
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
adjust yourself to what they're doing.

132
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,567
If a person consistently

133
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:12,372
pulls sideways more than average,

134
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,951
you're gonna have to modify your stab

135
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:16,264
in order to get him.

136
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,190
For example, had I gone

137
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:19,874
forwards and backwards here,

138
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:21,554
I wouldn't have gotten him.

139
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:22,740
What I had to do here

140
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:25,398
was to go sideways and backwards

141
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,686
to compensate for him
pulling sideways harder.

142
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,301
Again, here with this guy,

143
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,514
he pulls sideways very hard.

144
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:36,012
I go forwards+sideways, and backwards.

145
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,510
You just have to slightly modify

146
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:39,970
how you're starting the stab.

147
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,784
Other than that, there's also

148
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:43,321
a matter of correcting yourself

149
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,884
in case you go for it at the wrong timing.

150
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,096
Failing the stab is very easy.

151
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:49,704
Here, I know this scout is behind me,

152
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:51,898
I turn around, and go
forwards and backwards,

153
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:53,922
and he gets behind me.

154
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:55,946
He's not coming anywhere
 near this staircase,

155
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,827
but the next time I get near him,

156
00:05:57,851 --> 00:06:01,075
I go forwards backwards
and he's too far away,

157
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,490
and I just barely manage to do it again

158
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:04,521
to correct myself.

159
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:06,272
Had I not done it he would have

160
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:07,540
just turned around at me.

161
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,848
But it's not all about better players

162
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:12,608
or you failing. Sometimes it's about

163
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,731
your positioning in relation to him

164
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,310
when you start the stab.

165
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:18,829
You gotta understand how far to your side

166
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:21,773
they can get, while you're
going for the stab.

167
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:24,529
For example, here I understand that going

168
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,413
forwards and backwards would allow

169
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:28,414
this medic to get around me.

170
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,014
So I go sideways and backwards.

171
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:34,776
As for this scout, I sorta get stuck here

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,921
and he gets this far to my side.

173
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,284
At this point, I don't even go sideways,

174
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:40,948
I just go backwards.

175
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:43,719
The reason I'm bringing this up is because

176
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:46,518
once you learn the forwards
and backwards stab,

177
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,081
you tend to instinctively go forward,

178
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:50,670
even if you don't need to.

179
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:53,313
Like here, had I gone sideways backwards

180
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:55,624
or just backwards, I would have been

181
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,283
more likely to get behind him.

182
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,188
This stab is essentially just backwards.

183
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,058
If they get your side, that's all

184
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:03,666
you need to do in order to get it.

185
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,294
This means that even if you happen to

186
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,512
fail a matador, remember how they get

187
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,598
to your side like this, when you matador?

188
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:12,938
If you go for a matador, and you notice

189
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:15,334
that you failed in time, you can

190
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,335
go backwards to recover

191
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,205
and get the stab.

192
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,613
Now, if you go forwards and backwards

193
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:22,933
and they take it wider,

194
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,433
you can recover by going
sideways and backwards,

195
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:29,039
eventually gravitating towards them,

196
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:31,063
then going backwards.

197
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:34,235
Now, these are all very subtle
and accurate movements

198
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,797
and they are hard to see,

199
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:39,195
but once you do it yourself,
you'll understand.

200
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:42,404
Essentially you need to
get him on your side,

201
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:44,169
and then go backwards.

202
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,051
You get him to your immediate side

203
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,642
before you go backwards, to get him.

204
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:53,549
Essentially, there is no
forwards part to this stab.

205
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:56,316
The stab's purest and best form

206
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,411
is when you go only backwards.

207
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:02,455
You can get the best players
on level 4 by doing that.

208
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:05,934
While doing it you're also
going sideways in one direction.

209
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,627
But unlike in the level 1
circlestrafe stab,

210
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,633
you are not pushing into the space

211
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:12,224
behind the other player.

212
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,632
You're going backwards into

213
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:15,192
the space behind yourself.

214
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,867
Now, starting the stab from far away

215
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:19,265
like this, with backwards,

216
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,833
requires a lot of space.

217
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:22,672
So, typically you wanna try for

218
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:24,061
the sideways backwards, or

219
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:25,736
the forwards backwards stabs.

220
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,167
Now, when you go forwards and backwards

221
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:32,418
against people, even when
they get to your side,

222
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,097
they're still pulling
sideways to some extent.

223
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:37,480
So when I say you go backwards,

224
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:39,855
you are going backwards and sideways.

225
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:42,009
Let's take a look at this spy here,

226
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:45,176
I go forwards, and he pulls sideways

227
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,085
as I go backwards and sideways with him.

228
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,109
Not going sideways

229
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,938
while you go backwards,

230
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:54,091
will just result in you not hitting him

231
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:56,487
and him staying too far to your side.

232
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:59,120
And of course, when I say go forwards,

233
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,289
you're actually forwards and sideways

234
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,479
towards the guy.

235
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,011
Now, then won't always pull sideways

236
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:06,249
when you are going backwards.

237
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:08,144
But it's important that you understand

238
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:10,168
that you are going to have to be the one

239
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:11,423
who gets close to them,

240
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:13,881
that they're not running directly at you.

241
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:16,910
Now, people on level 4 often

242
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:18,934
get to the walls while strafing

243
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,958
because they are pulling sideways so much.

244
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:24,512
Now, as we remember,
getting a stab on the wall

245
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:26,536
on a person who's strafing towards you

246
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,435
is just a matter of just luck.

247
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,380
It doesn't really happen
normally, that much.

248
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,403
But getting a stab on the wall

249
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:36,427
on a person who is strafing away

250
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,172
is the easiest thing ever.

251
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,809
Usually, no form of matador or circlestrafe

252
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,833
would work on a person who's strafing

253
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:47,644
across the wall with his
back against the wall.

254
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:48,864
Like this.

255
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,162
Again, except for when you get

256
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:52,163
extremely lucky, that is.

257
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:53,872
A lot of people feel safer with

258
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,231
their backs against the wall.

259
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:57,255
When you go forwards they turn,

260
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,031
by going backwards, you can get the stab.

261
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:02,056
So generally, you see a person strafing

262
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:04,788
across the wall like this, for any reason,

263
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,173
you can just go forwards and backwards

264
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:08,635
to get him right there.

265
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:10,659
And it doesn't have to be across a wall.

266
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:12,869
I see this guy, he's strafing across here,

267
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:14,563
trying to attack from the side.

268
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:17,786
So I just know, what I can do against that.

269
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,020
Every time that you see a
person strafing across,

270
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:22,310
even just for a second,

271
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,827
that´s a golden opportunity for you

272
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,172
to go for the stab.

273
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:31,176
Now, at the beginning of all of this,

274
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,552
I told you about the hard time I had

275
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:36,576
with identifying this level.

276
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
But why is that? It's just

277
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:40,015
people strafing strafing across,

278
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,299
you can see that instantly.

279
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,979
They are trying to get
around you, it's obvious.

280
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,579
The thing is that not everyone

281
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,120
attacks like this while

282
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,752
they begin to attack,

283
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:51,776
when they're still far away.

284
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
They are not attempting to
attack from the side,

285
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:55,824
it's just that when they get close to you,

286
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,493
letting you pass becomes their reflex

287
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,490
right there, and not before.

288
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:02,514
Meaning that they're strafing towards you

289
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,732
until the last second.

290
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:06,123
The only difference being
that you don't get it,

291
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,442
you just don't get the stab.

292
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,247
And that's what confused me so much.

293
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,428
I'd see the guy strafing towards me,

294
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,973
I click at his side, the knife raises,

295
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:15,062
there is a crit sound...

296
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:18,347
But you'll never get the
stab on them like this.

297
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:21,335
Now, this means that
they can attack like this,

298
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,880
not coming anywhere near you,

299
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:26,628
or attack like that, making you think

300
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,315
that you're going to get the level 1 stab,

301
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,855
except that you don't.

302
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,149
In the end, they were doing the same thing.

303
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:35,358
See? They might strafe
towards you for a second,

304
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:37,382
before going around you.

305
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,786
That's just how level 4 works,

306
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,001
it chains itself with level 1.

307
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:44,221
Now of course, this means that

308
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:46,363
the level 4 stab that you try on them

309
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,699
will work in both situations.

310
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,010
But no matter how much it looks like it,

311
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:54,200
you can't get the level 1
stab on these people.

312
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,092
It can't replace the level 4 stab,

313
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,452
and the level 4 stab

314
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:01,490
can't replace the level 1 stab.

315
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,514
For example, this is what happens

316
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,538
when you go forwards and backwards

317
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:07,860
against someone who's on level 1.

318
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,854
I know that this spy is on level 1,

319
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:13,566
and that the level 4 stabs
are not working on him.

320
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,590
So only when I start using

321
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:17,292
the level 1 stab instead,

322
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,315
that's when he starts showing me his back.

323
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:22,044
It's about matching your movements

324
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:23,667
to what the other person is doing.

325
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,794
Now, knowing that these stabs
don't collide can help you.

326
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:30,088
When you see a guy running at you,

327
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,623
and you think he's gonna back off,

328
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:33,562
and he just keeps going,

329
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:35,586
when you are in a tight hallway

330
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:37,800
and he tries to get to the other side,

331
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,213
or if he just gets to the other side,

332
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:41,958
then that's a great way for you

333
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:43,982
to understand what he's really doing.

334
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,680
And to understand that you can go

335
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,562
forwards and backwards to get him.

336
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,545
Now, when people who are on level 4

337
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,351
are strafing across the wall,

338
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:58,290
it's always going to be the outer wall

339
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,314
of the turn that they're in.

340
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,026
Now, what does that mean?

341
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:03,594
See this scout?

342
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,762
He's level 4.

343
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,455
This is what he wants to see.

344
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,107
Ignore the stab for a second.

345
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:10,598
He wants to see where he came from,

346
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:12,482
he wants to see where he's going,

347
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:14,506
he has both doors on his view,

348
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,890
he has his back against
the wall, protecting him,

349
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,488
and he's attacking from the side.

350
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:21,679
This is what a person on level 4 wants,

351
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:24,267
he wants to see this bigger picture.

352
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,291
He wants to stay safe in all those ways

353
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:28,315
or at least some of them.

354
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,263
Sticking his back to the
outer walls of the turn,

355
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:32,748
keeping you on his view,

356
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:34,080
taking things wide,

357
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,882
attacking from the side.

358
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:37,987
When you see a person like that

359
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,930
you know what to do.

360
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,004
So level 4 has a lot of uses to it.

361
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:46,774
Some people will just run
at you with it mindlessly,

362
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:48,679
and some are trying to be careful,

363
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,714
strafing across some wall or something.

364
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,771
Getting around someone can be both

365
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:54,643
a completely defensive act,

366
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,496
and a completely offensive act.

367
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:58,346
There are people who just constantly

368
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,127
want your side aggressively.

369
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:01,690
And if they want your side,

370
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:04,603
sometimes you can give them your side.

371
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,088
Of course, if a person
tried to aggressively

372
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,761
get to your side and got stabbed,

373
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:10,597
being defensive afterwards,

374
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:13,113
doesn't mean that he
stopped being on level 4.

375
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:14,423
He won't get any closer to you,

376
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:15,998
but if you get close to him,

377
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:18,022
he's gonna fall for forwards and backwards.

378
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:20,547
And if you don't go forwards and backwards

379
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:22,571
he's gonna keep eventually strafing

380
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,378
to your side anyways.

381
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:34,811
Now, you may be asking, how can we even

382
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,375
stab a person like that,

383
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,902
who keeps himself safe in so many ways?

384
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,227
How can you go forwards and backwards

385
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:43,664
and get the stab on a person like that?

386
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:46,197
Well first of all, usually
this is what happens,

387
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:49,546
this is the most you can do, typically.

388
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,633
But when people are strafing
around you like this

389
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,142
they don't expect to even collide with you.

390
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,277
If they get behind you,

391
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:57,566
it's because you ran at them,

392
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,986
going for a matador.

393
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:00,981
But most of the time, they're just trying

394
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:02,015
to stay safe.

395
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:05,656
Now, all of this brings me
to this next point:

396
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,403
people on level 4 typically don't expect

397
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:09,490
to collide with you.

398
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:11,313
They expect to stay away from you.

399
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:14,510
Some people are better at
taking wider strafes,

400
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:17,143
but that doesn't stop your level 4 stabs.

401
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,833
And that's mostly because

402
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:20,331
the expect to get to your back,

403
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:22,503
but not to your immediate side.

404
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:24,684
When you force it onto them like this,

405
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,082
there's not much they can do.

406
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:27,135
But, then again,

407
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,032
some people eventually get used to people

408
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:31,585
showing them their side.

409
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:33,981
They don't turn by reflex

410
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,191
when you go forwards,

411
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:37,215
they turn because they are used to it.

412
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,658
In other words, they turn sooner.

413
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:41,713
Meaning that when you go backwards,

414
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:44,680
they are already able to
turn back at you again.

415
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,347
What all this means is that

416
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,120
they're going to get to your side

417
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:51,155
and stay on your side
without getting stabbed.

418
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,547
Now, once you see this
kind of thing happening,

419
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,070
what you need to do against these

420
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:58,205
kind of people who turn sooner,

421
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:00,682
is to simply time your stabs sooner.

422
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,452
Instead of letting them get to your side,

423
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:05,946
you're going to go backwards

424
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,636
while they're still in front of you.

425
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:10,000
Only then, when they pull sideways

426
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:12,459
and look sooner, you can stab them.

427
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,992
The stab itself can start looking

428
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,528
less than a forwards and backwards stab,

429
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:19,382
both to him and to you

430
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,253
when you get it like this.

431
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:23,430
But this is how it works.

432
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:25,187
Of course, it's better if you can time

433
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:27,598
all your stabs against this kind of persons

434
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,085
sooner, like this.

435
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:31,029
But this kind of thing is not absolute,

436
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:32,715
sometimes he's going to expect it

437
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:34,739
and sometimes he's just gonna turn to look.

438
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:36,763
And if you play it out well enough,

439
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:39,262
you can get him just normally.

440
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,156
So, moving on to a new topic,

441
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,509
in this next section, we are going to learn

442
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:46,657
a different approach to this level.

443
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:49,787
An approach that will really make it clear

444
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,874
why this stab is called strafing away,

445
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:54,868
as opposed to strafing behind
or something like that.

446
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,646
And with this new approach
we're gonna learn

447
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,990
new ways to execute this stab.

448
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,312
I'm talking about situations,

449
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,514
in which the angle for your stab

450
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:05,666
would get turned.

451
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,949
You'd get a turned level 4 stab.

452
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:10,973
Now what does that mean?

453
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,741
Until now we've talked about two situations

454
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,807
in which your sideways strafe

455
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:19,219
can collide with a person
who is strafing across.

456
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:21,434
He either gets behind you

457
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,660
or you get in front of him,

458
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:24,959
but you can't stab him.

459
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:28,171
Now this situation, is where the strafe

460
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:29,252
is edged out.

461
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:31,004
Once that happens,

462
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:33,028
they have to strafe away from you again,

463
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,344
because they've realized

464
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:36,003
that they couldn't get to your side

465
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:38,351
they couldn't stay away from you just then.

466
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:40,388
So it goes like that.

467
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:42,485
They can't just back off,

468
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:45,215
they have to enbox you between

469
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:48,194
the wall and them to feel safe.

470
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:51,173
Which is exactly what you would anticipate

471
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,197
and would do yourself.

472
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:58,116
Let's take a look at
another situation here.

473
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,167
Focus on that soldier.

474
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,795
Now, the stab could have ended like that,

475
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,670
but since you strafe sideways,

476
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:05,636
and not forwards and backwards,

477
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,838
then it ended like this.

478
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:10,635
Enboxing you between walls is what level 4s

479
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,043
usually do, by taking the outside

480
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,663
of the corners, they want to see

481
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:16,914
the inner walls of things, and you.

482
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,337
And when the strafe
gets edged out like this,

483
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:21,361
you disrupt their strafe

484
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:23,462
and get them to do it from the other side.

485
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:26,936
So whenever you fail a stab on the wall,

486
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:28,533
you know what to do.

487
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:31,037
Also, obviously whenever there's

488
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:32,703
some kind of prop or wall,

489
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,035
by going next to it, you can understand

490
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,094
exactly how they're going to go.

491
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:41,153
This is why C2C 2 works
so well, by the way.

492
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,107
All of these things melt into each other,

493
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:45,193
they chain each other,

494
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:46,825
because they are all a part

495
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:49,865
of the same thing: forwards and backwards.

496
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,634
But actually, for these stabs we didn't

497
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:54,117
really go forwards and backwards,

498
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:55,801
we went left and right.

499
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,102
It's kinda like a matador.

500
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,696
Well, it is.

501
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:03,205
Every spy eventually gets a stab like that,

502
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,840
it's nothing new to see this.

503
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,907
But this is not the only instance

504
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:09,251
in which the strafe gets edged out

505
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,040
for the people on this level.

506
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:12,487
And I know that a lot of spies

507
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,619
who can get this stab,

508
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,101
could also do something like that,

509
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,625
not really knowing what's
actually happening.

510
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,383
It's important to understand
that these stabs that you

511
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:26,496
are getting are actually level 4 stabs.

512
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:28,588
Although they're basic, you need to

513
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:30,196
understand that they're connected to

514
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,058
the forwards and backwards stab.

515
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,264
So in this whole section, we're going to

516
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,614
learn how to manage your matadors

517
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:38,638
against level 4s.

518
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,641
Now, other than the walls,

519
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:43,665
there are many, many reasons

520
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:45,848
for this to just repeat itself

521
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:48,688
over and over and over.

522
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:50,753
The strafe getting edged out is actually

523
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:52,524
a matter of feeling.

524
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,163
If he has enough time to see me

525
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:56,868
getting close enough to him,

526
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:58,727
then he's gonna change directions,

527
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:00,751
he's gonna know that he's
gonna collide with me

528
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:02,652
and he wants to stay away.

529
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:04,706
It doesn't only get edged out,

530
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:05,925
when you hit the wall.

531
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:07,949
See this? This was kind of familiar:

532
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,973
he took it wide and I strafed sideways

533
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:12,144
instead of forwards and backwards.

534
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,519
And since he had the extra second

535
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:17,613
to see me getting there,
he changed directions

536
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:19,637
because he wants to stay away.

537
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:21,981
See, it's a matter of feeling,

538
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:24,717
whenever they see that your
strafe might block them,

539
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,577
they change directions.

540
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:28,172
Let's take a look at this spy.

541
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,468
We both strafe to the left.

542
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:31,733
Now he's taking this turn wide,

543
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:34,363
but it looks to him that he'll bump into me

544
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:37,791
if he keeps going. You can see it, right?

545
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:39,496
So he changes.

546
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,462
What we talked about before, on the wall

547
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:45,706
is what happens when you really,
actually block them.

548
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:48,122
And it works in the same way

549
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,849
At some point, it really feels like

550
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,873
the strafe has reached its end.

551
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:55,866
and you're both changing
directions at the same time.

552
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:57,890
It's also a little intuitive.

553
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:00,189
For a second or two you are both

554
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:02,913
on the edge of each other's view,

555
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:04,802
that's when they change,

556
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:06,383
and you also change.

557
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:08,803
Obviously, this can happen more than once

558
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:12,010
it depends on the person's personal reflex

559
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:14,697
how many times, or from how close,

560
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,814
he feels like he should do this.

561
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:19,633
Also, as you've seen this
is one of those instances

562
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:22,823
where level 4 can collide with level 1.

563
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:25,019
Don't get confused by them backing off,

564
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:27,410
or strafing towards you, like this.

565
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:29,623
You can't get level 1 stabs on them.

566
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,165
Now speaking of the edge of the view,

567
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:35,934
another reason for them to change

568
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,827
when it's edged out like this,

569
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:40,075
is when they see your side

570
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,258
and they think they can stay on your side

571
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:43,848
by changing directions.

572
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:46,653
By timing it correctly, you can actually

573
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:48,219
get to their side.

574
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:50,384
See this spy?

575
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:52,663
He switches to his knife because he saw

576
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:55,268
that he got to my side there for a second.

577
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:58,031
So he thought it would happen again.

578
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:00,537
Let's look at it a little more simply,

579
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:03,355
he backs off here and he sees my side,

580
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,615
so he changes directions.

581
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,629
He lets me pass because he knows

582
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:09,094
I'm going to turn at him

583
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:11,118
once he's that far up behind me.

584
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:12,797
Now of course, I will turn,

585
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:14,482
but I will also strafe

586
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:16,506
so that I stay behind him.

587
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,403
People on this level are trying

588
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:19,523
to stay away from you,

589
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,250
and what better way than
staying behind you.

590
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,728
When the strafe gets edged out

591
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,578
they feel like you're going to turn

592
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:28,706
so they change directions.

593
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:31,153
And you can also feel it

594
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:32,830
if you just look hard enough.

595
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:35,530
Fun fact: while trying to stab people

596
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,862
you are also on level 4 sometimes.

597
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:40,258
Now the same thing happens with this guy.

598
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:41,481
I go forwards and backwards

599
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:42,755
and he gets behind me,

600
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:45,075
and at that point, I know that he is

601
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,099
going to change directions to try

602
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:48,168
to stay behind me.

603
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,375
This next guy is attacking from behind,

604
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:52,019
and I know that he's on level 4.

605
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:54,043
He shot once and he's already

606
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,531
going behind me.

607
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:58,091
And I knew that, so I went backwards,

608
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:00,115
and he got behind me anyways.

609
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,462
And at that point, he's gonna

610
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:02,823
change directions again to try

611
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,368
and stay behind me again.

612
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,130
It's all the same.

613
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:08,047
Let's take a look at it

614
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:09,761
from the scout's side this time.

615
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:11,247
He jumps over me,

616
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:13,271
he jumps over me again and again,

617
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:15,453
and even when he's not jumping

618
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,683
he going to be getting around me again.

619
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:21,522
And all these things that we talked about,

620
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:23,389
they all happen all at once,

621
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:24,351
and they chain each other.

622
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,274
For example, this guy gets around me

623
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:28,360
while taking the outside of the turn.

624
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:30,873
It's edged out, and once he got behind me,

625
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:32,730
he's going to change again.

626
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:35,683
Let's look at this spy's side of things:

627
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,879
he lets me pass here, and I keep

628
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:40,018
changing directions and edging him out

629
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:41,630
We end up getting to the wall,

630
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,273
where I can stab him.

631
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:45,297
Let's take a look at this spy.

632
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,011
He spots me immediately and goes around me.

633
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,743
Once he gets behind me

634
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,299
he's gonna go like this...

635
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:52,439
ignore the engie.

636
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,379
Here, he realizes that
he won't get around me

637
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:57,906
by doing this, so he has to change again,

638
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,930
because it gets edged out.

639
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:01,954
And at this point, I am
going up the stairs,

640
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:03,809
and this place is like a huge turn

641
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:06,002
and he's gonna take the outside of it.

642
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,652
By having all this knowledge,

643
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:09,676
you can manage your matadors

644
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,001
against these kinds of people.

645
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:12,309
But obviously, you don't have to

646
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:14,114
you can just go forwards and backwards,

647
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:15,175
and get them right there.

648
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,257
But I just want you to
understand this connection

649
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:18,523
and I want you to understand

650
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:21,190
how level 4 works with these examples.

651
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,692
For example this soldier here,
strafing across the wall.

652
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:25,849
I go forwards, sideways, backwards,

653
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:26,310
I get him.

654
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,811
And in another situation

655
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:30,032
with this soldier, he gets edged out.

656
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:31,437
I know he's gonna let me pass,

657
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:33,338
I know he's gonna be strafing away.

658
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,440
I can go right and left to get him.

659
00:24:35,711 --> 00:24:37,773
Understanding things about players,

660
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:39,705
gathering information is very important

661
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,729
for you to get any stab, really.

662
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:43,454
For example, this guy spots me

663
00:24:43,478 --> 00:24:44,871
and he's gonna move like this.

664
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:46,566
While up on that rock, I think that

665
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:48,629
he's gonna strafe towards me for a second,

666
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,173
but it chains with level 4,

667
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,197
he's obviously going to let me pass.

668
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:54,221
In this situation, it's pretty obvious,

669
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:55,973
he's just gonna go around me.

670
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:57,401
There's a bit of a blunder here

671
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:58,921
he pulls out his melee,

672
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:00,945
but he jumps behind me again.

673
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:03,853
At this point, he gonna jump
behind me again,

674
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,541
and I've finally realized what he's doing.

675
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:08,822
But I fail the stab.

676
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:10,846
So here he's gonna get around me again.

677
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,433
but he's gonna jump back around

678
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:15,802
one more time, more than I expected,

679
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:18,328
so it's like this. And at this point

680
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,197
I know how he's gonna move.

681
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:24,341
So that's it about managing

682
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:27,077
your matadors against level 4s.

683
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:32,021
So you can't just go for anything.

684
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:36,116
For now, let's go over the reverse angle.

685
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:39,080
We've kind of seen if before,

686
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,273
obviously from behind, people are also

687
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:42,600
strafing away from you.

688
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:45,516
When a person on level 4 chases you,

689
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:48,509
even from behind, you have
to do a level 4 stab.

690
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,986
If they begin attacking while behind you,

691
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:53,976
they will predict that you'll turn around.

692
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,236
So they try to get in front of you,

693
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,270
for when you do.

694
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:00,067
It's being careful. This spy for example,

695
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,295
chases me, and he chases me from the side.

696
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,651
See? Like this.

697
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:07,924
So I have to go sideways and
backwards, to get him.

698
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:11,897
Ok, so we go for a level 4 stab,

699
00:26:11,926 --> 00:26:13,652
but from which side?

700
00:26:13,677 --> 00:26:16,501
How do I know how to go for it?

701
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:19,750
Well, luckily we've just
learnt all about this.

702
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:21,992
I go for a level 1 stab on this guy

703
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:23,615
and he lets me pass.

704
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:25,790
Meaning he's on level 4, so I know

705
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:27,814
I need to go for a level 4 stab.

706
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,779
Now look at this, pretty much everything

707
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:31,803
to my right is a wall,

708
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:34,590
so I know that he's going
to try to enbox me,

709
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:35,797
like this.

710
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:38,190
So it's the same as going for

711
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:40,214
normal level 4 stabs, you just need

712
00:26:40,238 --> 00:26:42,807
to keep in mind the rules of level 4.

713
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:45,276
You open up space for him
to get around you,

714
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,965
just from behind. You wanna keep

715
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:48,437
yourself to the inner walls,

716
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:50,120
so they'll have an easier time

717
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:52,780
taking the outer wall like they want to.

718
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:54,428
You can just turn around and go

719
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:56,196
forwards and backwards, or you can go

720
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:57,761
backwards, and then turn around

721
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,318
and then go backwards again.

722
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,699
It will all have the same
result in the end.

723
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:05,790
A single instance in which, from behind

724
00:27:05,814 --> 00:27:07,610
they will back away from you,

725
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:10,302
allowing you to get a stab like this.

726
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,663
Is when before they came at you,

727
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:13,783
they thought to themselves

728
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,807
that they don't want to go around you.

729
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,658
This pyro, before even starting

730
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:20,690
to run at me, realizes that he doesn't

731
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:22,714
want to position himself

732
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:24,737
between the control point and me,

733
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:25,613
in case I moved.

734
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:27,339
Same thing with this medic,

735
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,174
who didn't want to fall off of the roof.

736
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,323
Now this has to be a
very conscious thought,

737
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:34,903
otherwise, they will just turn by reflex.

738
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:38,222
Ok so, as a continuation, let's talk about

739
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,247
overhead and underhead angles.

740
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:43,533
Obviously, they are being
done as level 4 stabs,

741
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:44,529
as we all know:

742
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,158
forwards and backwards.

743
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,700
Some people will do it very aggressively,

744
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:51,233
trying to jump next to you or even on you.

745
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:54,232
Others will try to jump away from you

746
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,644
and not even near where you were standing.

747
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,668
Still all the same in the end.

748
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:02,043
It's the same for under
and overhead angles.

749
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:05,064
Now, when you are going for a jump stab

750
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:06,629
you have to understand that you're not

751
00:28:06,654 --> 00:28:08,313
gonna jump straight at him.

752
00:28:08,366 --> 00:28:09,968
You're gonna jump sideways or

753
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:11,401
you're gonna jump backwards,

754
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:12,840
because he's going around you.

755
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:17,398
Also, the same perk that you had on level 1

756
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,864
with the overhead angle,
happens here as well.

757
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:23,805
In this situation, if I were
to strafe sideways,

758
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:24,991
I would not get him.

759
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:28,139
But if I jump sideways, I ignore bumping

760
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:30,724
into him, and I can still get the stab.

761
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,668
There are many ways to go
for an overhead angle

762
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,993
on players who are on level 4.

763
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:38,207
You just have to be creative about it.

764
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,504
Now, speaking of creativity,

765
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:47,674
if there's anything level 4s like doing,

766
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,702
it's pulling tricks.

767
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:51,981
Trying to get around you consciously,

768
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:55,121
much like spies. Now, any trick a spy

769
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:57,475
would go for, is just a very accurate,

770
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,704
basic level 4 movement.

771
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:02,188
If you manage to just step back

772
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:04,396
at the last second, you can counter them.

773
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:07,367
Any impro stab, any blind stab,

774
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,392
by running into it, you're moving

775
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,285
forwards, and by backing up at

776
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:13,309
the last second, you're stepping backwards.

777
00:29:13,672 --> 00:29:16,333
Now there are a lot of people on level 4

778
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:19,163
who know about cornerstabs and trickstabs,

779
00:29:19,187 --> 00:29:22,905
and will consciously move in those ways

780
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,984
in an attempt to outstrafe you.

781
00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:27,008
For example, this pyro,
he sees this corner,

782
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,311
he goes right and left,

783
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:30,354
and I can counter him like this.

784
00:29:30,378 --> 00:29:32,103
Now obviously they don't have to

785
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,127
be on level 4 to jump at
you from the corner.

786
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:36,411
But for people on either level,

787
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:38,388
it looks different.

788
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:41,000
And obviously, for people who are actually

789
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:42,918
on level 4, things are different.

790
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:44,716
When they back up into a corner,

791
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,436
and they see that you are chasing them,

792
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:47,519
that you're too close,

793
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,157
they're gonna let you pass.

794
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,129
Now that's just because they're taking

795
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:53,205
wide corners are reflex, not because

796
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:54,792
they know about trickstabs.

797
00:29:55,388 --> 00:29:57,628
They were backing away,
but you were too close

798
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:59,658
and it got edged out, so now,

799
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:02,397
backing away is to the other side

800
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,780
of the corner.

801
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,658
Let's take a look at this.

802
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:07,563
The spy is gonna back away from me,

803
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:09,741
into the corner, it gets edged out

804
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:10,714
because I'm close enough,

805
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:13,038
he changes, and then he changes again

806
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,597
as it gets edged out again.

807
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:16,739
Just level 4 stabs.

808
00:30:17,453 --> 00:30:19,275
Now whether people jump at you

809
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,837
from the corners consciously
or unconsciously,

810
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,919
It doesn't really matter, as long as

811
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:25,420
you know how to counter it.

812
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:28,604
Obviously, you counter cornerstabs

813
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,629
by just taking the corner wider.

814
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,143
Very simple.

815
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:35,209
But if you want to get a clean stab,

816
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,616
then that's not the best way

817
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:38,977
to go about it, because spies will see that

818
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,348
you've taken it wide, it gets edged out,

819
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,977
and they're gonna break away from you.

820
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,847
You gotta make it appear as though

821
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:47,994
you ran into the corner and that

822
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:50,139
there is no point in breaking away.

823
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:52,647
Now you can do that by running

824
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:54,495
straight at the corner and then

825
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,222
breaking off, going sideways

826
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:00,176
or sideways and backwards,
or something like that.

827
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,366
This is how you can make sure

828
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,501
that they turn.

829
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:05,281
And that's because what they wanted

830
00:31:05,305 --> 00:31:08,275
has happened: you ran straight after them.

831
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:10,526
Now it's very easy because the corner

832
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:12,323
is there, telling you what to do.

833
00:31:12,531 --> 00:31:14,347
You run at it, and you go sideways

834
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:16,917
and you run at it, and you go sideways.

835
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:19,750
Now, the more risk you take,

836
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:22,865
the more chances you'll have
of getting it, obviously.

837
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,208
But it's actually very very safe.

838
00:31:25,711 --> 00:31:27,883
Eventually, you'll learn to manipulate

839
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:29,907
this to your advantage completely,

840
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:30,962
and very easily.

841
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,761
Now obviously all of this is just a turned

842
00:31:33,785 --> 00:31:36,124
level 4 stab. When you run at the corner

843
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,366
and break away, then it's just like going

844
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,880
forwards and backwards,
only from this angle.

845
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,211
Like so.

846
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,454
Think about where they want you to turn,

847
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,836
and then going backwards instead of

848
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,371
running forwards.

849
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:51,361
It's just that not turning makes it

850
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:53,532
a little safer, because you know

851
00:31:53,556 --> 00:31:55,771
the exact angle of how it's happening.

852
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:58,701
Now, we'll talk more about spies later.

853
00:31:59,272 --> 00:32:02,890
For now, I wanna talk about something else.

854
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,484
I told you we'd be back to
doing this, earlier.

855
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:10,143
This is the continuation
of the level 3 section.

856
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:13,980
Now, level 3 is special,

857
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:16,230
because it always has another level

858
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:18,254
that comes along with it.

859
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:19,370
Is what the person would do

860
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,033
when he's not strafing around.

861
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:24,487
The people that we've
seen so far, on level 3

862
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,280
are people who are both strafing around

863
00:32:27,305 --> 00:32:29,599
and strafing towards, meaning they're both

864
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:31,128
on level 3 and 1.

865
00:32:31,837 --> 00:32:33,754
It's level 3/1.

866
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,209
This means that once he's
done strafing around

867
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:38,599
or once you catch him while

868
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,115
he's not strafing around,

869
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:42,445
he's gonna be strafing towards you.

870
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:43,868
That's why we jump straight for

871
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:45,773
the backpedal stab, like here.

872
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:49,002
And that's how they can
choose to strafe backwards,

873
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,064
once they reach the edge of their strafe.

874
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:53,493
But if you really look at the movements,

875
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:56,061
you can understand that this kind of thing

876
00:32:56,085 --> 00:33:00,378
could also happen. He can
just break off, like this.

877
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:02,435
This is what people who are both

878
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:05,701
on levels 3 and 4 are doing.

879
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:07,870
Breaking off level 3 at the edge

880
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:10,312
of their strafe, and going level 4 on you:

881
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,464
letting you pass, instead of backing off.

882
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:18,460
So before we dive into this level 3/4,

883
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:21,641
I wanna get some obvious
stuff out of the way.

884
00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:23,665
First of all, just how you can jump

885
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,185
straight to the backpedal stab

886
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:28,500
with level 3/1, you can jump straight

887
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:30,524
to the forwards and backwards stab

888
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,194
against level 3/4. Which means if

889
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:36,681
he chases you, either from behind

890
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:38,983
or because he thinks you are getting away,

891
00:33:39,074 --> 00:33:40,539
he's not gonna be strafing around,

892
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:43,227
he's gonna be chasing you with level 4.

893
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,928
Let's take a look at this guy.

894
00:33:45,952 --> 00:33:47,868
I know that he's on 3/4,

895
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,892
so when he chases me from far away,

896
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,253
I go for a level 4 stab.

897
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:55,381
But now I'm facing him, it's head-on,

898
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:57,820
we're fighting, he's gonna
be strafing around.

899
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,844
So I can just do it fast enough to get him

900
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:01,742
with a level 3 stab.

901
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:04,645
But wait, we've just talked about

902
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,271
how that shouldn't work,

903
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,295
I mean, they'd let you pass.

904
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,546
I mean if they strafe
very fast, their last strafe

905
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:15,038
is supposed to end like this, by reflex.

906
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:18,315
They normally shouldn't
fall for a level 3 stab.

907
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:21,489
See, even if you predict their fast strafes

908
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,964
and get to their side,

909
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,567
their reflex is going to save them.

910
00:34:26,603 --> 00:34:29,163
They're going to be strafing
away from you, right?

911
00:34:29,546 --> 00:34:32,437
Well if you have some crazy surprise angle,

912
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,375
you can get the level 3 stab,

913
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,734
like what's gonna happen here.

914
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,535
But in all other cases,
 it shouldn't happen.

915
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:41,066
For example, this guy

916
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,974
is chasing me right now, strafing across

917
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,869
the wall. Doesn't work out at first

918
00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:47,876
so I do a little bit of the
manage-your-matadors technique,

919
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,727
and get a level 4 stab.

920
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:52,010
Next time I see him, we fight head-on

921
00:34:52,035 --> 00:34:54,137
but I know that once I get close to him,

922
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,161
he's not gonna be strafing around anymore,

923
00:34:56,186 --> 00:34:59,142
because I had nothing
sneaky to throw at him.

924
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,558
I know that he's gonna
stop strafing around,

925
00:35:01,988 --> 00:35:05,255
and I should go for
the level 4 stab to get him.

926
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,618
So it works kind of like what you'd expect:

927
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:10,223
he's gonna be on level 3,

928
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:12,549
but eventually when you get close

929
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:14,761
he's gonna switch to 4, especially

930
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:16,142
if you give him the opening.

931
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,166
See? I'm strafing mostly on the right side

932
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,890
of this corridor right now

933
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:21,914
and he tries to pass from the left,

934
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,479
forwards backwards.

935
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:25,235
Now, you're rarely going to get

936
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:27,259
the forwards backwards stab on him

937
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:29,283
while facing him head-on like this.

938
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:31,150
You will mostly get them with

939
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:33,330
the manage-your-matadors techniques.

940
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,355
See, once you get close,

941
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:36,886
he's gonna be strafing away

942
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,975
just like this.

943
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:41,592
Meaning that also, when he
almost gets behind you

944
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:43,381
and when you almost get behind him,

945
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:44,907
the strafe is gonna get edged out,

946
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:48,452
and you're going to be
able to pull a level 4 stab.

947
00:35:48,831 --> 00:35:50,891
It means that at times, he's going to

948
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,571
try to enbox you between
the wall and himself.

949
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:56,060
And all of these things will melt

950
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:58,684
into each other: this guy
keeps letting me pass

951
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,369
while he's moving around.

952
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:02,393
And it gets edged out as we both

953
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:05,478
get to the wall, and I
can stab him right there.

954
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,308
And obviously, remember that people who are

955
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:11,994
on level 3/4 still do all the crazy stuff

956
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:14,018
that level 4s are trying to do to you.

957
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:15,922
Like jumping at you from the stairs

958
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,946
or jumping at you from the corner.

959
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:19,613
Let's take a look at that guy.

960
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,994
I try to level 3 him and he keeps going,

961
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:24,069
but how much you wanna bet that he's

962
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,740
gonna use this turn right here as a corner

963
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,627
and try to cornerstab me with it?

964
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:32,196
Now, this probably gives
you all a very specific

965
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:34,832
idea right now, and it should.

966
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,108
Even though they usually go level 4

967
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:40,512
at you, which is really hard to counter,

968
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,949
there's still one consistent way

969
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:45,227
to get people on 3/4

970
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:47,572
if they're doing one specific thing:

971
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:49,233
and that's if they're trying to

972
00:36:49,336 --> 00:36:53,326
outstrafe you using left
and right, to get around you

973
00:36:57,442 --> 00:36:59,781
Up until now, we've been talking about

974
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:01,461
people who are strafing around

975
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,575
for the sake of being fast.

976
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,281
But some people are strafing left and right

977
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:09,029
to consciously try to outstrafe you

978
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:11,053
and get away from you.

979
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:14,003
Let's look at his spy's side again.

980
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:16,028
Now it already looks the same to them,

981
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:18,275
you either run at them, and they feel like

982
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:20,098
they should let you pass,

983
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:22,064
or you run at them, and they feel like

984
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:23,675
they should go left and right,

985
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,773
literally, trying to sort of
matador you with his gun.

986
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,075
Now sometimes he will succeed,

987
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:32,429
and sometimes he will not.

988
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:35,606
Now that only depends on how you move.

989
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:37,631
They can control where you'll look,

990
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:39,654
but not where you'll be,

991
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,486
in front of them or to their side.

992
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:43,482
For example, this guy.

993
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:44,882
He strafes to the right, and at

994
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:47,459
this point, he expects me to turn

995
00:37:47,483 --> 00:37:49,947
and he expects me to get outstrafed

996
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:51,369
and to stay in front of him.

997
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,165
Now, of course I turn,

998
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,827
but I ended up at his side instead.

999
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,988
Now, the thing about people

1000
00:37:58,013 --> 00:37:59,510
who are trying to outstrafe you,

1001
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:01,534
is that the closer you get to them

1002
00:38:01,558 --> 00:38:03,558
the shorter their strafes will get,

1003
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:06,037
as they continue trying to outstrafe you.

1004
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:08,693
Let's take a look at this guy.

1005
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:10,354
He goes all the way around me,

1006
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:11,696
but he sees that I turned,

1007
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,484
so the next time he goes right and left

1008
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,606
to try to mislead me better.

1009
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,322
Now, to you, the stab can even look like

1010
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:20,484
a leading stab, but it's not about

1011
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:21,686
how it looks to you.

1012
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:23,481
One very important thing that

1013
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:24,815
you have to understand

1014
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,497
for this stab to happen

1015
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,619
is that it doesn't depend
on how you see it.

1016
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:33,311
It only depends on how he sees it.

1017
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,341
What movement he even does to outstrafe you

1018
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:38,238
only depends on him.

1019
00:38:38,645 --> 00:38:40,262
For example, here. At this point

1020
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:43,841
he understands that I can't
pass him right here,

1021
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:46,170
and he's gonna feel like he's going to

1022
00:38:46,194 --> 00:38:47,685
able to outstrafe me again

1023
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,709
or at least keep me in front of him again.

1024
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:51,836
See, here when I try to strafe

1025
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,205
over from the left

1026
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:55,303
and I see that I can't pass him,

1027
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:57,327
but the next time I correct myself.

1028
00:38:57,843 --> 00:38:59,777
And he's not going to correct himself,

1029
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:02,753
because it worked out for
him that first time.

1030
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:05,183
You mostly, you need to make him

1031
00:39:05,602 --> 00:39:07,564
think that he's gonna outstrafe you,

1032
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:09,133
that you are just running at him,

1033
00:39:09,495 --> 00:39:11,696
or that you are strafing, but he'll

1034
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,297
be able to get to your side

1035
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:15,833
or get out of the way of your shots.

1036
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,869
It's not about tricking him, because

1037
00:39:17,894 --> 00:39:19,744
whether you try to trick him or not,

1038
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:21,385
he's gonna do the same movements.

1039
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:23,216
He's either gonna let you pass

1040
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,104
or strafe in both directions.

1041
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:26,949
What you need to do is try to

1042
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:29,595
intercept one of those: the level 3 stab

1043
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,595
or the level 4 stab accordingly.

1044
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:35,565
Ok now, we've looked at a
lot of these stabs,

1045
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,935
but we haven't really learnt

1046
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,557
about how to make them

1047
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,752
choose what you want them to choose.

1048
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:44,181
I mean, how can I be sure of whether

1049
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:46,550
he's gonna outstrafe me by letting me pass,

1050
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:48,574
or by going left and right.

1051
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,987
So let's take a look at this guy.

1052
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:52,336
Once I go to his side,

1053
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:54,332
it's easy for him to let me pass.

1054
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:56,267
But once I just run at him like this

1055
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:58,035
from the middle, it doesn't look to him

1056
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,733
like he can let me pass

1057
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:01,757
by only going in one direction.

1058
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:04,268
You need to understand that if you run

1059
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:07,598
to one of the spots, you are
running to his side,

1060
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:10,640
you're leaving a lot of space for him

1061
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:12,276
to let you pass.

1062
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:13,864
So in order to get them

1063
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:16,040
to outstrafe you with left and right,

1064
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,875
you need to teach yourself

1065
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:19,717
how to run at their middle.

1066
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:21,332
See, when you pull out your knife

1067
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:23,861
you naturally go sideways,

1068
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:25,703
so you're going to have to use

1069
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:27,727
some unnatural movements.

1070
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:29,751
You wanna use glue.

1071
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:32,503
Now, glue works very well

1072
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:34,527
on people who are trying to outstrafe you,

1073
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:36,327
because their strafes get shorter

1074
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,162
the closer you get, and that's

1075
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,764
the kind of thing you want for glue.

1076
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:42,161
When you strafe sideways,
you're still away from them,

1077
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:44,381
so they can afford a long strafe.

1078
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,713
And when you strafe forwards at them

1079
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,626
with glue, since you're moving

1080
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,315
with this angle at them

1081
00:40:50,562 --> 00:40:51,922
it doesn't look to them like

1082
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:53,531
they can let you pass.

1083
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:54,985
Let's take a look at this.

1084
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:57,009
I miss a perfect opportunity

1085
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:59,033
to do it here, by reflex.

1086
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,512
And my reflex keeps taking over.

1087
00:41:01,536 --> 00:41:04,094
I strafe to his side and he lets me pass.

1088
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,417
I try again, he lets me pass,

1089
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:08,005
again, pass.

1090
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:10,029
Then, I try for glue,

1091
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,403
and he uses left and right.

1092
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,447
Let's take a look at this guy.

1093
00:41:16,471 --> 00:41:18,536
I keep going for his side,

1094
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:21,165
on so he keeps letting me pass.

1095
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:24,288
So I can only get him with a level 4 stab.

1096
00:41:24,836 --> 00:41:26,110
But here, he's gonna be strafing

1097
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,812
left and right, really fast,

1098
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:29,146
and then he's gonna take

1099
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:31,081
a very long strafe to the right.

1100
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:33,271
So, I just know he's gonna strafe

1101
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:36,173
back to the left, and I let him do it

1102
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:39,336
so I could get him with
his next right strafe

1103
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,526
See? I glued myself to him,

1104
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,748
I predicted where his middle would be

1105
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:46,306
and I stayed there.

1106
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,140
Now, even if you're using glue

1107
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:51,769
this is all very subtle movement.

1108
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:53,057
Even if you go for it,

1109
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:54,838
it might not look the way

1110
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:57,715
you wanted it to look
for him at some times.

1111
00:41:57,796 --> 00:42:00,790
Keep on trying, though.

1112
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,601
Now, on a finishing note here,

1113
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,364
let's talk about some
possible things for 3/4.

1114
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:11,188
Some people can switch it up
and strategize with it.

1115
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,250
For example, some people
will get around you

1116
00:42:13,274 --> 00:42:15,274
with level 4, and then start strafing

1117
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:17,555
around when they're at your side.

1118
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:19,790
Now, for the most part,

1119
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:22,099
you can just get them with either stab

1120
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,595
if you just predict, where they'll be,

1121
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:26,804
either to your side or in front of you.

1122
00:42:27,232 --> 00:42:29,773
But really, this kind of thing only depends

1123
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,566
on the individual. You are going to have to

1124
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,043
see what they're doing,

1125
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,307
figure it out for yourself.

1126
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,837
For example, this guy,

1127
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:38,044
we fight around trying to shoot each other

1128
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:40,765
for a second there, he jumps to my side

1129
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,207
and then immediately goes back to where

1130
00:42:43,231 --> 00:42:45,650
he was before, strafing around.

1131
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:48,292
So now, the next time he does this

1132
00:42:48,558 --> 00:42:50,777
I know exactly how to move.

1133
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,075
He was showing elements of

1134
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,687
doing this before: getting around me

1135
00:42:55,711 --> 00:42:57,711
and then backing up, instead of

1136
00:42:57,735 --> 00:42:58,990
completing the move.

1137
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:01,898
Meaning that even if he's strafing across,

1138
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:03,595
if I go forwards and backwards,

1139
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,738
he will back off.

1140
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:06,762
So even though it has elements

1141
00:43:06,786 --> 00:43:08,131
of level 4 in it,

1142
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:11,710
I should always go for the level 3 on him.

1143
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:15,705
So that's it about level 3/4.

1144
00:43:16,045 --> 00:43:17,729
But speaking of people

1145
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:19,017
who are going right and left

1146
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:21,332
in order to mislead other people.

1147
00:43:21,546 --> 00:43:24,037
What about us? Spies with matadors.

1148
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:26,606
It can go like that, but it can also

1149
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:27,731
go like that.

1150
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:29,996
Getting counterstabbed is one of the most

1151
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:31,549
confusing things that can happen

1152
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:33,658
to you in this game as spy.

1153
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:37,277
So, just let me tell how to do it

1154
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:39,301
to all your best friends.

1155
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:48,464
Spying is such a delicate art.

1156
00:43:48,762 --> 00:43:50,488
Of course, then we go and exploit

1157
00:43:50,512 --> 00:43:52,512
every little thing about it

1158
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:53,737
like this... Oh well.

1159
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:55,589
Well anyways, we already know

1160
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:58,137
how to counter some of the more known

1161
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:59,450
tricsktabs already.

1162
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:01,965
They are all, without exception, being done

1163
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,989
with level 4 movements.

1164
00:44:04,013 --> 00:44:05,897
By running into it the way the spy

1165
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:07,921
wants you to, you go forawrds

1166
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,522
and by backing up at the last second

1167
00:44:09,556 --> 00:44:10,965
you go backwards.

1168
00:44:11,184 --> 00:44:13,507
But for now, we are gonna focus on

1169
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:15,456
how to counter matadors.

1170
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:18,290
Now obviously, matadors that we think of

1171
00:44:18,335 --> 00:44:20,222
is the level 3 stab, right?

1172
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:21,518
He leaves you some space

1173
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,338
and you go for it.

1174
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,952
But unlike with the level 3 stabs

1175
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:29,496
you don't really rely on
predicting spots that much.

1176
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:32,206
A good spy that really knows how to matador

1177
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,892
doesn't just do it by strafing

1178
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,291
left and right repeatedly.

1179
00:44:35,691 --> 00:44:37,167
They move around, they shoot,

1180
00:44:37,192 --> 00:44:39,192
and they try to make you buy the direction.

1181
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,216
and of course you buy the direction

1182
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,522
but instead of going at them,

1183
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:44,658
you go sideways.

1184
00:44:45,927 --> 00:44:48,127
It's kinda like level 3, but it's not.

1185
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,068
You wait for him to leave you the space

1186
00:44:50,092 --> 00:44:52,092
to go forwards and then you go for that.

1187
00:44:52,415 --> 00:44:54,291
But it's not really about level 3,

1188
00:44:54,548 --> 00:44:56,186
it looks more like level 1:

1189
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,896
they gravitate towards you.

1190
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,877
So it's actually even further than level 4.

1191
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:02,901
Whenever a spy fails his trick,

1192
00:45:03,252 --> 00:45:04,925
this guy just jumped or something,

1193
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:06,565
he's gonna strafe towards you

1194
00:45:06,596 --> 00:45:08,483
right after that, because he feels that

1195
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:09,986
he can stab you at that point.

1196
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:12,268
So it's not so much about the level 3

1197
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,292
as it is the 1, just keep strafing

1198
00:45:14,317 --> 00:45:16,838
predict that's he's going to
gravitate towards you,

1199
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:18,521
sometimes even backwards.

1200
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:20,440
Eventually, even if a spy

1201
00:45:20,465 --> 00:45:22,684
is strafing around and it seems random,

1202
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:24,708
the moment you take a wide strafe

1203
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:26,195
around him, he's gonna have

1204
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:27,827
a longer strafe towards you.

1205
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:29,837
Just like how I gravitated towards

1206
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:31,147
the demoman over here.

1207
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:33,328
But looking even more closely,

1208
00:45:33,352 --> 00:45:35,376
even though they might be strafing around

1209
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,124
at first, if you bump into them,

1210
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:38,453
it will get edged out

1211
00:45:38,811 --> 00:45:41,126
and they'll do a level 4 movement.

1212
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:43,651
So like we've expected at the beginning,

1213
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:47,741
even a matador is essentially
a level 4 movement.

1214
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:50,715
It will turn into it, even if initally

1215
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,599
it's done by strafing left and right.

1216
00:45:52,855 --> 00:45:55,180
So when this spy is done doing his thing

1217
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:56,613
and you're still facing him,

1218
00:45:56,638 --> 00:45:58,287
you can probably get him with

1219
00:45:58,332 --> 00:46:00,332
one of the other level 4 stabs.

1220
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:02,601
The same rules apply: he takes the

1221
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,935
outer side of the corner wide, like that.

1222
00:46:05,618 --> 00:46:07,326
And when the strafe gets edged out

1223
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:08,755
he's gonna change directions,

1224
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:10,218
expecting you to look.

1225
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:12,395
And when you are both at the wall,

1226
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:13,990
he is going to try to enbox you

1227
00:46:14,014 --> 00:46:16,014
between himself and the wall.

1228
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:19,280
And really, you could try
for any level 4 stab.

1229
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:21,304
Now, you can go forwards and backwards

1230
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:22,535
in a lot of ways.

1231
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:24,996
But one of the best ways I find

1232
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,686
for doing this is, while facing the spy,

1233
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,710
for a split second just run at him

1234
00:46:29,734 --> 00:46:31,465
and bait him to go around you.

1235
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,688
His reflex will make him do this,

1236
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:35,440
because once he's out with the knife,

1237
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:38,644
he wants to capitalize on
that one split-second

1238
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:40,438
in which you are running into him,

1239
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:41,505
to matador you.

1240
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:44,352
Now it sounds dangerous
and obviously it is,

1241
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:46,501
he has a chance to stab you

1242
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:48,372
when you are going forwards against them.

1243
00:46:48,825 --> 00:46:51,362
So you just might get matadored anyways.

1244
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:56,550
Now although all matadors can end the same,

1245
00:46:56,574 --> 00:46:59,060
in the end, we do have a level 3 matador

1246
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:00,684
and a level 4 matador.

1247
00:47:00,874 --> 00:47:02,259
And because of all of that

1248
00:47:02,626 --> 00:47:04,343
a spy with the knife out

1249
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:07,440
can always be treated as a level 3/4.

1250
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:08,974
You could take him with both

1251
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:11,639
the level 3 stab and the level 4 stab.

1252
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:13,067
Let's have a look.

1253
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,174
I miss the forwars then backwards stab,

1254
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:18,082
and then he goes right
and left, and I get him.

1255
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:20,832
But once again, despite all of this,

1256
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:22,856
good spies have a preference.

1257
00:47:23,517 --> 00:47:25,928
For example, this guy.
I get him with a glue stab,

1258
00:47:25,952 --> 00:47:27,665
which is a backpedal stab.

1259
00:47:28,058 --> 00:47:30,758
Like the level 1 stab,
like the level 3 stab.

1260
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:32,416
And it's stupid of me

1261
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:35,491
to go for a level 4 stab against him here

1262
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:38,459
when he's obviously not
going to go around me.

1263
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:40,322
Now, depending on how things go,

1264
00:47:40,346 --> 00:47:43,116
I might eventually make him go around me

1265
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,698
and get a level 4 stab.

1266
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:47,337
But initially, as I start facing him,

1267
00:47:47,361 --> 00:47:48,772
he will never do it.

1268
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:51,350
I need to go for a level 1 stab.

1269
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:54,111
Now again, here I get a perfect chance

1270
00:47:54,136 --> 00:47:55,706
to go forwards and backwards.

1271
00:47:56,066 --> 00:47:58,115
But I noted the spy doesn't go

1272
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,817
around me that much. I know that he's

1273
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:01,683
gonna change back directions.

1274
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,041
So that's the stab I go for.

1275
00:48:05,413 --> 00:48:07,673
But all of that is just the movements.

1276
00:48:08,776 --> 00:48:11,093
Spies have a thousand tricks

1277
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,841
and it's not always about the knife.

1278
00:48:12,953 --> 00:48:15,436
They're not always gonna
have a shank out with you.

1279
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,650
You need to know how to get yourself

1280
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:19,071
into that situation.

1281
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:21,095
Some spies will only shoot at you

1282
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,645
and some will just run away.

1283
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,339
And even while knife fighting, some spies

1284
00:48:25,363 --> 00:48:27,236
are very very difficult to get.

1285
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,814
For example, this guy

1286
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,562
only has short strafes.

1287
00:48:30,587 --> 00:48:32,587
He doesn't wanna walk into me like this.

1288
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:35,056
And stabbing him is not gonna be that easy.

1289
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:36,716
You are gonna have to shoot at him,

1290
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:38,561
push him to a tight spot, and only then

1291
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:39,783
could I go for it.

1292
00:48:40,432 --> 00:48:42,492
But there's also an upside to all of this,

1293
00:48:42,517 --> 00:48:44,681
people who usually would've been juking

1294
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:47,016
while not stabbing you,
have to at least have

1295
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:49,967
short strafes while they
are trying to matador you.

1296
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:52,491
You can't matador with jukes.

1297
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,026
Your last strafe has to be longer

1298
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,511
if you want to stab.

1299
00:48:56,973 --> 00:48:59,155
This means that instead of going for glue

1300
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:00,695
on spies who are juking,

1301
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:02,817
if you know that they're
going to try to stab you,

1302
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:05,202
you can just predict that and counter them,

1303
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:07,226
going for the stab more normally.

1304
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:09,349
And some spies just like shooting

1305
00:49:09,374 --> 00:49:11,402
before they stab anyways.

1306
00:49:12,424 --> 00:49:13,633
You just have to weave

1307
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:15,819
the intensity of the situation.

1308
00:49:16,183 --> 00:49:18,274
Go for the better angle, if you can.

1309
00:49:18,298 --> 00:49:20,216
Make it obvious but safe.

1310
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:23,014
Try to intercept with the other spy's

1311
00:49:23,038 --> 00:49:25,339
gun-knife ratio, try to know

1312
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:26,507
when to go for it,

1313
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:29,364
since he won't always answer
to your knife fight.

1314
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:34,006
Now, every spy goes for a matador.

1315
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:36,797
Some go for it aggressively, like that guy.

1316
00:49:37,192 --> 00:49:41,410
And some only use it as a
last resort, like this guy.

1317
00:49:41,706 --> 00:49:44,214
But every spy does it eventually,

1318
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:46,637
whether they're weak and
they see the opportunity,

1319
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,952
or they feel like you're just
running at them.

1320
00:49:48,976 --> 00:49:51,874
Every spy will eventually do it.

1321
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,690
Now, good spies who know you

1322
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:57,485
will probably not go for it immediately.

1323
00:49:57,509 --> 00:49:59,509
They shoot, they try to avoid,

1324
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:01,974
they try to do stuff... But in the chaos,

1325
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,039
after all of that, every spy goes

1326
00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:06,400
right and left as you get close.

1327
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:07,931
And with time, you'll know how

1328
00:50:07,932 --> 00:50:10,297
to time it and use it to your advantage.

1329
00:50:11,212 --> 00:50:13,466
Now, every spy does it eventually,

1330
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,490
even if they tell themselves to stop.

1331
00:50:15,514 --> 00:50:18,568
For example, it's often
a spy's first reflex

1332
00:50:18,593 --> 00:50:20,455
to matador you when you randomly

1333
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,031
run into each other, like this.

1334
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:24,948
Also, it could be that you
forced the spy into it.

1335
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,366
Look at this, I'm just
gonna run at this guy,

1336
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,744
he tries to back off, but as I get closer,

1337
00:50:29,768 --> 00:50:32,095
it becomes a very logical choice.

1338
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:33,248
You can force it onto them.

1339
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:35,884
Sometimes, if a spy is
running at you like this

1340
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:37,165
shanking you and hitting you,

1341
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:40,107
it becomes your only
option to try and stab him.

1342
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:43,511
So it's either that, or you can just

1343
00:50:43,536 --> 00:50:45,393
run at them and make it look

1344
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,961
like you're gonna fall for it,

1345
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:49,466
like it's the best thing to do right now.

1346
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:51,950
Just run straight at them and break off

1347
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:53,123
at the last moment.

1348
00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:01,073
Now, good spies

1349
00:51:01,097 --> 00:51:03,428
are used to circle strafe-ish stabs.

1350
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:05,452
They know that this kind
of thing can happen,

1351
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:07,038
even if they don't change directions.

1352
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,507
So, you can sometimes bait
them into doing that, too.

1353
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:12,984
Strafe straight sideways,

1354
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:15,034
make it feel safe for him

1355
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,937
to strafe across some wall

1356
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:18,527
into you, for a stab

1357
00:51:18,614 --> 00:51:20,830
and go backwards at the last second.

1358
00:51:21,644 --> 00:51:23,161
Don't go for it like you'd usually

1359
00:51:23,186 --> 00:51:25,186
go for sideways and backwards though.

1360
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:27,673
You risk getting stabbed by doing that.

1361
00:51:27,865 --> 00:51:30,092
What you wanna do is strafe sideways,

1362
00:51:30,193 --> 00:51:31,718
then at the last moment

1363
00:51:31,742 --> 00:51:34,442
look at him as you are going backwards.

1364
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,795
But please, please remember that

1365
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:38,819
even if you look ahead,

1366
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,524
you look at him again to stab,

1367
00:51:41,549 --> 00:51:42,392
you're adjusting.

1368
00:51:42,426 --> 00:51:44,426
He can still slip by and get you.

1369
00:51:44,573 --> 00:51:46,535
But since you know about it while doing it,

1370
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,384
then it's not that likely to happen.

1371
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:50,677
So, this is a nice example here.

1372
00:51:50,701 --> 00:51:53,001
I strafe in long, straight lines,

1373
00:51:53,025 --> 00:51:55,999
baiting him to strafe across
the wall to get me.

1374
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:59,635
Then I go sideways and
backwards, to get him.

1375
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,490
Now, to counterstab a spy, you have to

1376
00:52:03,515 --> 00:52:05,548
make sure that he's actually stabbing.

1377
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:08,483
Some might just try to shank
you and shoot you.

1378
00:52:09,065 --> 00:52:10,786
And some, are just straight up

1379
00:52:10,814 --> 00:52:12,130
trying to shank you.

1380
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,211
They can sometimes seem far away

1381
00:52:14,235 --> 00:52:16,468
and difficult to stab, but remember that

1382
00:52:16,492 --> 00:52:18,428
even if he stays far away,

1383
00:52:18,516 --> 00:52:20,649
you can get closer to him.

1384
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,572
Now, speaking of adjusting your angle,

1385
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:25,031
this is something very important

1386
00:52:25,055 --> 00:52:26,589
that you need to understand:

1387
00:52:26,613 --> 00:52:28,767
a spy's average strafe

1388
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:31,581
is way shallower than the strafe

1389
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:34,131
of someone who's just moving around.

1390
00:52:34,304 --> 00:52:35,970
That's because they're
expecting you to run

1391
00:52:35,995 --> 00:52:38,502
straight at them, while stabbing.

1392
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:41,261
Meaning that you don't really need any

1393
00:52:41,387 --> 00:52:44,313
backwards strafes really, just a nice

1394
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:48,091
sideways strafe can have
you avoid most stabs.

1395
00:52:48,393 --> 00:52:50,181
Again, as long as you're strafing

1396
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:51,823
even if you don't see it coming,

1397
00:52:51,847 --> 00:52:54,432
it's very hard to get you with a trickstab.

1398
00:52:56,522 --> 00:52:59,212
Now, every spy is capable of doing those.

1399
00:52:59,236 --> 00:53:02,430
But, what about circle strafing spies?

1400
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:05,375
Spies who know as much as you now.

1401
00:53:05,973 --> 00:53:07,600
Now, the both of you are trying

1402
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:10,464
the better angle for when you collide.

1403
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,650
But when you collide,
and it doesn't matter how

1404
00:53:13,674 --> 00:53:15,969
it's gonna turn into a backpedal stab

1405
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:18,381
Doesn't matter how you collide with him,

1406
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:20,565
you can go forwards and
backwards and get him,

1407
00:53:20,589 --> 00:53:22,334
and you can go forwards and backwards

1408
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:23,705
and get stabbed yourself.

1409
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:25,251
And anyways, it's always about

1410
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:27,044
the levels 1 and 4.

1411
00:53:27,068 --> 00:53:28,389
They counter each other.

1412
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,837
For example, a circlestrafe on this guy

1413
00:53:30,861 --> 00:53:33,275
who is on level 1, ended this closely

1414
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:36,618
because at the end of a
strafing towards strafe,

1415
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:38,642
there's always strafing backwards,

1416
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:41,804
which is pretty much going
sideways and backwards.

1417
00:53:42,664 --> 00:53:46,793
See? The last moment is
the only thing that matters.

1418
00:53:47,377 --> 00:53:50,323
Now, as the other spy's movements

1419
00:53:50,347 --> 00:53:53,402
become more precise, it gets more difficult

1420
00:53:53,427 --> 00:53:55,427
for you to do whatever you want with him.

1421
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:58,286
Winning a circlestrafe battle

1422
00:53:58,538 --> 00:54:00,815
is not like winning a backpedal battle,

1423
00:54:00,915 --> 00:54:02,569
which usually means you just got

1424
00:54:02,593 --> 00:54:04,458
further back than the other person.

1425
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:07,444
Winning a circlestrafe battle is more about

1426
00:54:07,468 --> 00:54:09,911
where he looked, it's about the adjustments

1427
00:54:09,935 --> 00:54:12,767
and not about who gets further back.

1428
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:15,113
And also logically speaking

1429
00:54:15,196 --> 00:54:18,010
the more you reveal your back to a spy,

1430
00:54:18,112 --> 00:54:20,646
the more he will turn in order to stab you.

1431
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,605
You see, when a spy is circlestrafing,

1432
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:25,910
even if he's doing it very carefully,

1433
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:27,742
he's pushing into you,

1434
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:30,095
which means he doesn't detach from you.

1435
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,418
Now this means that you can go for the stab

1436
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:36,327
from the inside, much more
easily than normal.

1437
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,222
You don't wanna go for a stab normally,

1438
00:54:38,246 --> 00:54:40,828
you wanna spot his long strafe.

1439
00:54:41,223 --> 00:54:42,900
Just spot his strafe

1440
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:45,354
and don't try to take him wider than him.

1441
00:54:45,669 --> 00:54:48,148
Run into him, let him
almost get to your side,

1442
00:54:48,172 --> 00:54:51,154
and that will make him
turn his view for the stab.

1443
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:53,276
Whether it's level 4 or 1,

1444
00:54:53,383 --> 00:54:55,574
you run into the spy and pull sideways

1445
00:54:55,598 --> 00:54:58,137
for the split-second backpedal
stab that we know,

1446
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,976
going for the stab from the inside.

1447
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:02,292
Let's take a look at this.

1448
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:04,146
He goes left and now he's gonna go right,

1449
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,093
but I don't try to take
it wider than he does.

1450
00:55:07,118 --> 00:55:09,465
He will turn by himself to stab me.

1451
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:11,072
Now, this is not something that

1452
00:55:11,097 --> 00:55:12,572
you can pull on everyone,

1453
00:55:12,603 --> 00:55:14,299
only on spies and only

1454
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:15,893
when they are trying to stab you.

1455
00:55:16,263 --> 00:55:18,467
You can go either sideways or backwards,

1456
00:55:18,744 --> 00:55:20,822
just don't turn too much yourself.

1457
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:25,866
Now, on a finishing note here,

1458
00:55:25,893 --> 00:55:27,911
sometimes you will attempt this stab

1459
00:55:27,935 --> 00:55:30,314
and he will get completely behind you

1460
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,634
and... yeah...

1461
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:35,579
Sometimes a spy is so laggy

1462
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:38,096
that it's not even worth fighting with him.

1463
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:40,986
Sometimes it can get pretty ridiculous.

1464
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,010
Let's take a look at this next frame,

1465
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:43,823
right after this one...

1466
00:55:44,398 --> 00:55:45,612
It can get painful,

1467
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:46,933
it can get a little painful,

1468
00:55:46,957 --> 00:55:49,265
knowing that this kind of
thing can actually happen.

1469
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,593
Working so hard, and knowing what to do,

1470
00:55:51,617 --> 00:55:53,896
and timing it right, and then just have it

1471
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,467
blow up in your face, quite literally.

1472
00:55:57,214 --> 00:55:59,735
If you catch yourself or the other spy

1473
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:02,257
warping around or lagging or

1474
00:56:02,451 --> 00:56:05,124
something like that: stop immediately,

1475
00:56:05,232 --> 00:56:06,452
because no matter who wins

1476
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:08,292
there will be nothing to gain from it.

1477
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:09,938
If you don't stop I can assure you that

1478
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:13,253
something horrible, horrible,
will happen to you.

1479
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:16,749
So yeah, try to avoid

1480
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,773
fighting spies like these.

1481
00:56:18,977 --> 00:56:22,007
But don't give up on
fighting spies altogether.

1482
00:56:22,032 --> 00:56:23,613
There's so much you can learn,

1483
00:56:23,637 --> 00:56:25,014
just by fighting with them.

1484
00:56:25,245 --> 00:56:26,881
Not just knowing what to do,

1485
00:56:26,974 --> 00:56:28,795
but understanding angles better.

1486
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,682
Knowing how it really feels

1487
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,108
is not something that you
can do by watching videos

1488
00:56:33,135 --> 00:56:35,171
but only by experimenting and

1489
00:56:35,196 --> 00:56:36,962
experiencing it yourself.

1490
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:38,913
And this kind of thing is not possible

1491
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:41,003
to do against a soldier, who has rockets

1492
00:56:41,028 --> 00:56:42,783
and splash damage, and people who just

1493
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:44,738
mow you down the moment they see you.

1494
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:46,490
It's possible to do with someone

1495
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:48,786
who is initially equal to you.

1496
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:51,631
So fighting spies is a very important part

1497
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:53,942
of stabbing, and a very important part

1498
00:56:53,966 --> 00:56:55,966
of learning, and getting better.

1499
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:58,465
So even if you get robbed sometimes,

1500
00:56:58,657 --> 00:57:00,450
don't give up on it.

1501
00:57:06,806 --> 00:57:08,883
Well you guys, we've reached

1502
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,027
a certain milestone!

1503
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:14,031
We've covered all the basics.

1504
00:57:15,074 --> 00:57:17,205
What we'll see in the next videos

1505
00:57:17,244 --> 00:57:20,069
will be considered the more advanced stuff.

1506
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:22,767
So stick around,

1507
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,946
and I'll see you then!
