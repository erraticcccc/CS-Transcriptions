1
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:24,610
Alright, glad to have you back!

2
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:27,014
In this next part, I wanna start

3
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:29,038
introducing something more advanced.

4
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,992
Extensions of level 4 I like calling

5
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:33,447
THE AMAZING LEVELS

6
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:36,854
We're starting with the level 4.1.

7
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:38,458
Well, it's still level 4,

8
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,887
so let's go for a level 4 stab, and...

9
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:42,762
it does not work.

10
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:45,185
On this level, people are
looking to outstrafe you

11
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:47,627
much like in level 4, but this time,

12
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:49,382
they are doing it by backing off.

13
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:51,738
See? The moment I go forwards, he flies

14
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:53,573
all the way back, and then

15
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:55,603
he outstrafes me from the other side.

16
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,611
So level 4 stab or level 1 stab,

17
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:00,668
it's hard to say what we should do really.

18
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:02,698
I don't really have to
say that these people

19
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:04,722
are very hard to reach.

20
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:07,987
Now, this amazing strafe is fundamentally

21
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:10,063
different from the level 1 strafe,

22
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:12,172
from people who are just backing off.

23
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:14,727
For now, the best way I can explain it is:

24
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:16,751
this is a backing-off strafe,

25
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:20,801
and this is an amazing strafe.

26
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:26,499
This exaggerated thing is
what we're dealing with.

27
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,795
It always outstrafes you.

28
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:32,111
You think you're close enough, and then...

29
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:34,482
This is really the closest you can get.

30
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:36,843
So, there are a couple of things for why

31
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:39,246
this is happening, so
let's just dive right in.

32
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,369
Well, in order to outstrafe you like this,

33
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,393
they can't just just back
off normally, right?

34
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:46,178
They have to attack from the side, and then

35
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:48,381
they're able to back off to your side.

36
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:50,464
They have to go sideways a little bit

37
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:51,971
when going forwards, right?

38
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,580
I want you to look at what he's doing.

39
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:55,604
He's attacking from the
side and backing off,

40
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:57,628
attacking from the side and backing off.

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
Let's take a look at this guy from before.

42
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:03,309
He's strafing across the wall,
then he backs off,

43
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:05,705
he's attacking from the side
but he's backing off.

44
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,307
Let's take a look at this next guy.

45
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,523
He's gonna be strafing across the wall,

46
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,911
but can you see him backing off

47
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,887
instead of getting behind you completely?

48
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:15,668
I manage to get him with a level 1 stab

49
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:18,757
on the wall there,
which is really unlikely.

50
00:02:19,948 --> 00:02:21,241
And I'm gonna tell you why

51
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:22,783
it's even more unlikely

52
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,470
with level 4.1.

53
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:26,713
He's gonna be attacking from the side

54
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:28,737
and then he's gonna be backing off, right?

55
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:31,478
But, by attacking from the side like this

56
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:33,146
he puts himself in a position

57
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:35,368
to potentially turn. So even if you get

58
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,366
close enough with a level 1 stab,

59
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,246
 he's going to be breaking away.

60
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:40,980
These people are putting themselves

61
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,398
in a position where, if you get close,

62
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:45,029
they get to change what they're doing.

63
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,968
So, these guys are still on level 4

64
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:50,650
and they're doing level 4 things,

65
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,674
like breaking away and letting you pass.

66
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:55,051
But if you go for a level 4 stab

67
00:02:55,357 --> 00:02:56,569
you're not getting it, because

68
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,244
 they're backing off, even though

69
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:59,693
they were attacking from the side.

70
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:01,588
And not to mention that all the

71
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:03,289
managed matador techniques that you're

72
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,784
not getting on them because of how

73
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,808
intense and wide their movement is.

74
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:09,089
So you try to go for a level 1 stab

75
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:11,384
only to find them breaking away again.

76
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,087
So it's impossible, you go for one stab

77
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,889
and they choose the other form of movement.

78
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,238
By attacking from the side,

79
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,262
they're giving themselves
the chance to turn,

80
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:22,075
and then potentially break away

81
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,743
from you if they want to.

82
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,178
And that's if they don't just

83
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:26,651
outstrafe you right away.

84
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,103
This is why this level is "amazing",

85
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,771
they get to change what they do,

86
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,760
they get to choose to suddenly

87
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:35,395
change their form of movement.

88
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:36,956
Simply put, you're not getting

89
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,980
a basic stab on them usually.

90
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,988
But still, they can turn the
strafe and break away,

91
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:45,532
and in case they do, you
do have a slight opening

92
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,193
to stab them sometimes.

93
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,382
He's gonna take it wide,

94
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:51,407
back off, and break away...

95
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,361
You can just only sometimes get this stab,

96
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:57,203
but it's very unreliable.

97
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:59,065
And it's a lot more confusing

98
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,391
than just that to fight somebody on 4.1.

99
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,930
He takes it wide and
backs off, then suddenly

100
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,745
he does it again...

101
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:08,681
But miracles sometimes
happen. See this guy?

102
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,109
He's gonna turn the strafe, but he's not

103
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,671
gonna break away, and I get him.

104
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,842
And these things happen
even to the best players.

105
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,784
This guy can jump to my side and jump

106
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,440
backwards, which is really skillful

107
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:19,732
movement-wise.

108
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,862
But sometimes I can
still get him with this.

109
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,276
So sometimes you can get
backpedal stabs like this.

110
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,867
Mostly on the ones that are not

111
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,630
as used to breaking way.

112
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:32,560
And if you're getting it,
it's almost always

113
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,567
going to be because of the adjustments.

114
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:36,904
It's always going to be very close.

115
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,066
Also, even if they turn completely,

116
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,648
sometimes you can extend it

117
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:43,583
into a backpedal stab, sometimes.

118
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,231
Or you could try anticipating

119
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:47,255
them turning the strafe in the first place,

120
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:49,175
forcing them into the stab.

121
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,385
But that's not very reliable
either, isn't it?

122
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:54,741
So sometimes, if you get over or

123
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:56,765
under them, you avoid bumping into them

124
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:59,027
and you can get the stab, exactly as

125
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:00,560
it was in the previous levels.

126
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,515
See, I get under him here,

127
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,484
whereas if we were on the same plain

128
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,133
he would've just bumped into me

129
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:08,393
and denied me the stab.

130
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,997
Same thing here, only from above,

131
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,213
see how much he's gonna turn the strafe?

132
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:15,822
If we were in the same plane, I would've

133
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:17,344
not been able to get him.

134
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:19,479
Same thing here. I got for the stab,

135
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:22,248
I can't get to him, next time
he's gonna back off

136
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:25,204
I go for an overhead angle, which again

137
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,473
allows me to ignore bumping into him.

138
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,802
So yeah, obviously these kinds of things

139
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:32,318
can happen, but usually, they're not

140
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,959
very reliable either.

141
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:36,482
So moving on a little bit, this action

142
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,506
of taking something wide
and then backing off

143
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,646
kinda reminds us of something right?

144
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,656
Reminds us of C2C,

145
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,780
so let's talk about corners for a bit.

146
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:47,100
C2C is just a level 1 stab

147
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,124
which would usually not work here

148
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,537
because they turn the
strafe. But if it's just

149
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:53,840
enclosed in enough, it could work

150
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,054
even though they turn it.

151
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:58,179
Also about corners, in the corner

152
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,546
forwards and backwards strafes turn into

153
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,661
left and right strafes,

154
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,618
because they have no space behind them.

155
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,445
Backing off becomes sideways.

156
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:07,847
Also, when you're in a
corner, the angle turns,

157
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:10,149
so he's strafing forwards
and backwards right now,

158
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,278
but I can treat it as if it was

159
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:14,302
left and right, I can cut the corner

160
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:15,981
and stab him that way.

161
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:18,411
But still, we just went over some

162
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:21,047
things that could help
you against these people.

163
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:22,929
But none of them are really

164
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:24,744
reliable or consistent.

165
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,732
Level 4 stab doesn't work,

166
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:28,502
level 1 stab hardly works.

167
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:31,026
We need to find a reliable way

168
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:32,678
to get these guys,

169
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,620
and this is where it starts.

170
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:37,284
So what even happened here?

171
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:39,038
He outstrafes me by going

172
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:40,480
forwards and backwards, ok,

173
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:42,134
then he goes around me

174
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:43,996
but we know that at this point

175
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:46,034
I can't get him with a level 4 stab

176
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:47,760
because he's gonna back off, and you

177
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:49,549
can't even go for a backpedal stab.

178
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,498
So instead of doing those,
you start the stab

179
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:55,277
like you do with level 4,
you let him get to your side,

180
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,930
and then as you're pressed against him,

181
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,906
you go for the backpedal stab.

182
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,964
So this stab, that combines the level 4

183
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,992
and the level 1 stabs, is actually glue.

184
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:08,901
So what does this glue stab

185
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,436
actually do for us here?

186
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,704
Why do we use it?

187
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,433
Well, let's break it down.

188
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:16,310
When a person on 4.1 is attacking you

189
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,225
from the side, he's opening
up an opportunity

190
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:21,441
for himself to turn should you

191
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,756
strafe to his side. But rather than running

192
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,067
to his side, when you run at his face,

193
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:27,606
you're still in front of him.

194
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:31,043
When you use glue, you
don't get to his side,

195
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:33,446
so he can't turn to his side. If anything

196
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,975
he turns away because of the adjustments.

197
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:38,211
Look at the difference between what

198
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,540
happens here, and what
happens the next time.

199
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:42,715
By sticking to him like this,

200
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:44,739
you don't give him the chance to turn.

201
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:47,696
It's about fixing the adjustments

202
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,583
so they would be locked
on looking forwards.

203
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,734
Let's take a look at this guy.

204
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:57,011
I try to strafe around him, he backs away

205
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,782
to the side, breaks away...

206
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:01,261
But when I go for glue,

207
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:04,524
I fix his adjustments forwards like this,

208
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:07,360
so he couldn't turn or keep away from me.

209
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:09,722
Now that's what usually happens,

210
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:12,247
but it's either that or they do turn,

211
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:15,041
but by gluing to them, you got further back

212
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:16,456
than when they turned to.

213
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:18,771
Let's explain this for a second.

214
00:08:18,962 --> 00:08:20,660
This guy's gonna attack me from the side,

215
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:21,922
rounding the corner,

216
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:24,008
and then he backs off and he can turn,

217
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,038
and I'm right there in front of him.

218
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:28,067
But if I stick to him,

219
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,742
when he turns, he's not gonna see

220
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,766
anywhere when he backs off,

221
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,919
unlike before.

222
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,668
And he's already turned as much as he can

223
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,015
before backing off, so

224
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,065
he can't turn more than that.

225
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,749
You see, when you're circlestrafing

226
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,637
you leave him space to walk into you

227
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,754
which means that if he turns, he sees you.

228
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:49,849
But if you run at him, if you glue to him

229
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:52,091
he turns, and then,

230
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,753
you are just not there anymore.

231
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:55,935
I actually started understanding

232
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,817
why sticking so close like this

233
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:58,960
is that important

234
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:00,613
in this next clip right here.

235
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,377
I'm gonna attack from the side,

236
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:06,225
he's gonna walk, I'm gonna outstrafe him,

237
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:07,482
then he walks again,

238
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:09,422
and he's just not there.

239
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:12,118
This is why, by the way,
it's really important

240
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:15,663
to look back at things that
happen to you when they do.

241
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,444
He didn't stab me there because

242
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:19,932
he didn't try to, he was just trying

243
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:20,733
to get to the health.

244
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,628
Which brings me to my next point.

245
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,963
When you are stabbing as a spy,

246
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,320
you are on level 4, meaning that you make

247
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:29,344
this half of a circle thing

248
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,656
when you are trying to do it,

249
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:32,245
even if you are trying not to.

250
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,820
And this space between you

251
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:36,676
lets them turn at you.

252
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,224
See, even if you are trying to run

253
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,500
at a person's face, and really just

254
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,635
try to walk into him while stabbing,

255
00:09:42,737 --> 00:09:44,443
the moment you pull out your knife

256
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,525
you hit the strafe key and
you turn the mouse

257
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,549
and that makes a circle, whether you

258
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:49,682
like it or not.

259
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:52,132
See, this spy is gonna come at me

260
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,973
in a second, he's gonna outstrafe me

261
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:55,309
and at this point

262
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,089
you'd usually go like this

263
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,271
trying to go around him.

264
00:09:58,295 --> 00:09:59,525
But had I done that,

265
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,095
I would have made a half-of-a-circle

266
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,744
and I wouldn't have gotten
as far behind him

267
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,631
as I did. I would have also

268
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,140
given him the space to turn a little more

269
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,402
and to break away.

270
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,805
So let's just recap a little bit, for now.

271
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:16,856
This guy: 4.1, amazing backwards strafe,

272
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,185
breaks away from me, then goes around me,

273
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:20,219
then backs off.

274
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:23,929
So just remember they start
with a level 4 movement,

275
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:26,205
then they back off across something.

276
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:30,229
The stab itself can happen when you lock

277
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:31,751
their adjustments forwards

278
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,460
or it could also happen
when they've turned,

279
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,484
but you've gotten further
than they've turned.

280
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:39,819
Both of these cases are only possible

281
00:10:39,843 --> 00:10:41,480
because you stick to them

282
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:43,656
so now we know why it's so important

283
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,184
while doing the glue stab.

284
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:47,893
When they're moving around,

285
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:49,615
always try to imagine a corner

286
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,864
or a turn or something, that they take wide

287
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:53,292
and then they back off to.

288
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:56,095
It generally helps to see this game

289
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,790
as turns and corners.

290
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,219
You can actually just practise this stab

291
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,249
with C2C: give your side to the player,

292
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,273
and then turn and try to stab him.

293
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,460
But actually, why is that?

294
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,021
Why do you have to run straight and

295
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:10,044
give your side to him,

296
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,664
you can just do it more normally.

297
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,726
Just turn and press W instead of

298
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,750
running forwards. It doesn't have to be

299
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,774
that hard, because you know
where he's coming from

300
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,458
and you know how the stab is gonna end.

301
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,401
So that's the thing, you don't.

302
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:24,617
People who have this amazing strafe

303
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,479
can keep outstrafing you by surprise,

304
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:28,087
even if you think you're gonna get it.

305
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:30,963
So the stab doesn't always end on the side

306
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,097
which you thought it would.

307
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:35,214
See how many he keeps
crossing me over here?

308
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:37,309
Unlike when you are going for a normal

309
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,111
circlestrafe or a backpedal stab,

310
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,753
you don't know how this is gonna end.

311
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:43,502
I really can't determine that it's

312
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:44,857
like this right now,

313
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,359
and just turn to that side to begin with.

314
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:49,383
It's not gonna work most of the times,

315
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,996
and that's because they're gonna keep

316
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,185
outstrafing you by surprise,
they're gonna keep

317
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,393
crossing you over.

318
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,595
And neither of you really knows

319
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,831
how it's gonna end. But let's go

320
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:01,066
a little deeper into how this works.

321
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:03,516
How do you just run like an idiot

322
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,199
and somehow do something that works?

323
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,760
Well, let's take a look at this here.

324
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:09,935
Let's see how this goes,

325
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,510
I go for the circlestrafe, and hell

326
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,973
if that works... because of,
well, everything.

327
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:15,788
So I run at him.

328
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:17,343
He went forwards, now he's gonna go

329
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,612
backwards, and he outstrafes me, right?

330
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:21,640
So at this point, he gets to my right,

331
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:24,483
so I look forwards and press
the right key.

332
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:26,039
But what's this? He's crossed me over

333
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:27,767
again, so now I'm gonna run forwards

334
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,141
and press the left key.

335
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,396
And at this point,

336
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,812
I don't feel like I'm moving
to the left anymore,

337
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:35,213
which means I'm bumping
into him, which means

338
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:37,715
I can turn and try for the stab again.

339
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:40,139
So in a nutshell: you need to keep strafing

340
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:43,155
towards him with really shallow strafes,

341
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,358
strafes that will let him get to your side.

342
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:46,872
He's supposed to just see you

343
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,946
running forwards and
wiggling back and forth.

344
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,190
Again, I run at this guy,

345
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:52,705
he strafes to the right, I strafe right,

346
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:54,180
he strafes left, I strafe left,

347
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:55,921
and at this point I don't feel

348
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,303
like I'm going left anymore.

349
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,578
Which means he's trying
to move to the right,

350
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,927
but he can't do it, he can't cross me over.

351
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,944
So now, I can turn for a stab.

352
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:06,719
One more example,

353
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:09,575
I go for this guy, he
backs off, outstrafes me

354
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,658
I run at him holding the right key,

355
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:14,427
I run at him holding the left key,

356
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:17,563
I feel like he's blocking me, so I turn

357
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,956
and I stab him.

358
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,513
Now again, at this point

359
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,114
it does not work like a level 1 stab.

360
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,357
If I go around him here,
I'll give him space

361
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:28,294
to turn at me, which is
something I don't want.

362
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:31,290
Here's an example, I'm gonna
try to glue this guy,

363
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,805
running to the right, then he

364
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,208
crosses me over, goes to the left,

365
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,616
and instead of going to the left,

366
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:37,003
and continue gluing him,

367
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,465
I go around him, which is bad.

368
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:42,400
I gave him the space to turn
and get behind me again.

369
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,290
You have to keep glued to him.

370
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,314
This is still the exact same stab

371
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:48,040
as before, this is just a twist

372
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:50,064
for people who don't strafe
across immediately

373
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,917
and spam forwards and backwards.

374
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:53,986
Now, especially for people who aren't

375
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:55,848
strafing across some wall or something

376
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:57,670
immediately, making it obvious,

377
00:13:57,926 --> 00:13:59,211
you don't know how it's gonna end

378
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:00,700
it can end in a lot of ways.

379
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:02,829
Since you're running straight at them

380
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:05,025
you can get confused,
but you're expecting it,

381
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:06,759
so everything that's gonna happen

382
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,733
is gonna be within what you expect.

383
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,963
And it can also unfortunately end

384
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:12,885
with them getting completely away from you,

385
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:14,279
which can also happen.

386
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:17,116
My point is, none of this
is a reason to not do it,

387
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,718
this is how the stab
works. Locking yourself

388
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,640
forwards like this doesn't restrict you,

389
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:24,216
running straight isn't
bad in this situation

390
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,071
it's just how the stab works, and it's just

391
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:28,148
like how you get used to circlestrafing.

392
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:30,216
You get used to doing this mid-combat,

393
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,759
gunfight and everything,

394
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,929
and you're just running straight.

395
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:39,565
Now, speaking of people who
are spamming movement,

396
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:43,651
how can this level exactly
combine with level 3?

397
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,324
Strafing around, remember that?

398
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:47,348
Well, this is a pretty good example.

399
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,095
Spy strafing left and right,

400
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,210
but when I go for the free spot,

401
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:52,350
he turns on me.

402
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,653
Again, these people can easily

403
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,128
outstrafe your circlestrafes,

404
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:58,377
so the same thing happens when you try

405
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,858
to go for a free spot.

406
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,187
See? He turned and he's
not walking into me.

407
00:15:02,224 --> 00:15:04,224
I got kinda lucky there
because of the wall,

408
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,938
but it typically doesn't work.

409
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:08,148
So instead of going for the free spot

410
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,282
strafe with him, and go for the glue stab.

411
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:13,872
See, because he does the same thing,

412
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:15,467
you should go for the same thing.

413
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,396
It's simple, he's on level 3

414
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,550
and then when you get close,

415
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:19,629
he's on level 4.1.

416
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,822
But there are actually several
ways of doing this,

417
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:24,962
like we've seen before, a lot of people

418
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:26,505
spam forwards and backwards

419
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,733
like it was level 3,

420
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:29,688
trying to outstrafe you that way,

421
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,523
or just trying to be fast.

422
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:33,112
This guy for example,

423
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,640
he's trying to outstrafe me by going

424
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,328
left and right, and backwards.

425
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,276
So sometimes it depends on how they do it,

426
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,707
So, it can be simple, you can go for just

427
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,708
a circlestrafe or just a level 3 stab.

428
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,252
But it depends on what he does more.

429
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:48,774
For better players, it gets
more complicated

430
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,798
and you wanna be able to
pull it off consistently

431
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,317
instead of just once.

432
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,787
Now, this next guy is gonna be juking

433
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:57,396
and on 4.1, which works out for us,

434
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,018
because both forms of movement

435
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,511
are countered by glue.

436
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:04,063
So that's a very nice
coincidence of movements.

437
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,018
And speaking of those,

438
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:08,312
going back to the level 3 section again,

439
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:12,131
if a spy is on 4.1 or juking or both,

440
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:13,999
it's scary to go for glue,

441
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:16,023
because you're practically running with W,

442
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:18,831
so he can stab you. But if he's a spy

443
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,866
who tries to stab you, he has to

444
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,890
do it with a longer sideways strafe.

445
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:25,397
So again, you can just go for a counterstab

446
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:27,421
normally, if you know that's what he does.

447
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,437
And that's it about that.

448
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:31,964
But as you can see, there's

449
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:33,277
still time for this video.

450
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,340
At the beginning, I talked about more

451
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:37,163
extensions that level 4 has,

452
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:38,853
and this is the next one.

453
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,623
The amazing 4.2.

454
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:45,237
Now, this level is much more like

455
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,006
the level 4 that we already know,

456
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,207
the normal level 4.

457
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:50,556
Only this time, it's taken to an extreme.

458
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,580
They take things extremely wide

459
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:54,326
passively or aggressively,

460
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,095
they time it unlike others

461
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,649
in order to outstrafe you.

462
00:16:57,673 --> 00:16:59,673
Sometimes to circlestrafe you.

463
00:16:59,697 --> 00:17:02,236
One very obvious thing according to which

464
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,209
you can identify this level is that, from

465
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,699
the beginning, they take very
very wide circles.

466
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:08,380
They never get close to you unless

467
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:09,534
they're sure of themselves.

468
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,704
But we already have people like this,

469
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:12,892
so what's the difference?

470
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,916
Well, people who are on 4.2

471
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,966
are going to take something wide

472
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,658
and then they will continue
to widen the circle,

473
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:22,800
until the point where they're
just moving sideways.

474
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:28,040
It's easy to explain this
movement in a corner,

475
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:30,388
when even after taking a corner wide

476
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:33,073
he keeps moving to the side
and away from you.

477
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:34,780
Let's take a look at this scout.

478
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,308
He's gonna take it wide, but he's

479
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:38,163
gonna keep moving sideways

480
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,187
after the wall stops restricting him.

481
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,868
He wasn't stuck on the line of the wall,

482
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:45,704
he could keep widening the
circle after it ended.

483
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,679
Although people who can only do this

484
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:49,588
in corners aren't worth mentioning.

485
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:50,936
We're talking about people

486
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,444
who can do this on the outside.

487
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,461
So yeah, they usually take strafes so wide

488
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,224
that you can't do anything about.

489
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,998
But much like any other level 4, by taking

490
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:01,727
wide strafes they eventually get

491
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:03,175
to the sideways walls.

492
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,543
And if you catch him
strafing across the wall,

493
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:07,706
you can use that to your advantage.

494
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,942
So you can lure these people into

495
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:12,511
some place enclosed off,
where there's a lot of walls,

496
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:14,455
and catch them there,
because they won't be able

497
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,055
to pull sideways anymore, as much.

498
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,318
Normal level 4s are very restricted

499
00:18:19,342 --> 00:18:20,933
with how much they can pull sideways

500
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,195
and these people aren't.

501
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:24,830
So you can use the wall to completely

502
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,505
restrict them and bring them down to the

503
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,407
level of normal level 4s again.

504
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,430
Now speaking of things that will work

505
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:32,985
on all level 4s,

506
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,294
the manage-your-matadors techniques

507
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,815
are something you will not be able to

508
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,825
do with people with the amazing 4.2.

509
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:42,895
Here, the guy tried to enbox me between

510
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,010
the wall and himself, but I bumped

511
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:46,805
into the ceiling and landed sooner

512
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,774
than he expected, messing up his timing,

513
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,535
it's the only reason I got that.

514
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,261
But basically yeah, they're
very wide level 4s

515
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:57,976
so you go for very wide level 4
stabs on them, simple.

516
00:18:58,686 --> 00:18:59,878
But then again, you don't really

517
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,441
wanna do it normally, because they expect

518
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:03,569
to get to your side.

519
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:06,553
So again, any stab you'd want to go for

520
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,308
is going to be an early level 4 stab

521
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:11,076
you always want him in front of you,

522
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,885
you never wanna let them get to your side

523
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:14,680
before you go backwards.

524
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:16,441
You go sooner than you expect

525
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:17,956
all of that, all of what we know.

526
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,285
Getting it is kind of hard to do,

527
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,194
so you're gonna have to
get used to doing it

528
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:24,218
like this. And mostly you can't really

529
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:26,847
anticipate how far to the side they'll go,

530
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,507
so if anything, just go backwards,

531
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,245
it's the best option for these people.

532
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:33,452
I mentioned before that the best type

533
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:35,142
of a level 4 stab is the one

534
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:37,476
that's just backwards, with no forwards.

535
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,291
Here, for example, I just moved backwards

536
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:42,060
and right to open up space for him,

537
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:44,223
and then I moved backwards
and left to stab him.

538
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:47,713
But in case none of those is an option,

539
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,161
which is usually the case,

540
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:51,530
you don't really want to go
forwards and backwards

541
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:52,671
against people like that,

542
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:54,266
you want to go forwards and backwards,

543
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,188
and then forwards and backwards again,

544
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,956
in combination with sideways, you want

545
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,038
them to keep moving their mouses around.

546
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:03,087
Don't be all steady and
make it easy for them.

547
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,028
But optimally, you don't want them

548
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:07,673
to make this circle to begin with

549
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,608
because it always has the potential

550
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:11,632
to move sideways and away from you,

551
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,656
and it's very easy for that to happen.

552
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:16,226
So you wanna time your stab

553
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,831
to start at the guy's face

554
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:20,855
when he's starting the circle.

555
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,411
The less circle you let him do

556
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,524
and the more he stays in front of you

557
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,993
instead of to your side,
the better you're off.

558
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:31,657
Now obviously, there are the more

559
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,505
normal ways of getting these people

560
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:36,389
like overhead stabs and understabs,

561
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:38,937
in the air they can't control
themselves as well,

562
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:41,032
or it can give you an extra angle

563
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:43,057
like we know, like with every other level.

564
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,163
And you need to know this, especially

565
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:46,271
if they jump around a lot,

566
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:47,519
like these guys. You can take

567
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:49,314
advantage of it really easily.

568
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:52,523
Or with a surprise stab, obviously

569
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:54,646
by surprise they usually can't widen

570
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,770
their strafe, you can get an
easy stab on them

571
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,584
although you're still
not getting a matador.

572
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:00,609
Now, next up we have to consider

573
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,988
how this level can collide with level 3,

574
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,616
how it can combine with level 3.

575
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,291
It's what you'd think, it could be just

576
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:08,842
long strafes, one of which will

577
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,996
attempt to go around you at some point.

578
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:14,446
And that's it, I guess.

579
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,528
You know, I haven't really found

580
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:19,097
a really solid way to deal with these guys.

581
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,633
The 4.1 section used to be empty

582
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:23,201
like this one, because I hadn't

583
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:24,696
found out about glue yet.

584
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,758
It's only by observing and experimenting

585
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:28,782
that we can find loopholes

586
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,255
in people's forms of movement.

587
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:31,863
And speaking of which,

588
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:33,285
it's about time we moved on

589
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,953
to the last form of movement

590
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:37,763
that we are going to learn
about in these videos.

591
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:39,787
And man, is it an interesting one.

592
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:42,284
This level is about pursuit.

593
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:44,954
People who are this far away from you,

594
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:46,552
are suddenly right there

595
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:48,259
and about to catch up to you again.

596
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:49,875
How does this happen?

597
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:52,084
Now that happens because of something

598
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:53,532
that we already know about.

599
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:56,642
And this next level revolves
completely around it:

600
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,150
cutting corners.

601
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,033
This is the last of the
amazing strafe levels:

602
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:02,186
level 4.3.

603
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:05,497
Now, as I said, we've seen this before

604
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:08,133
because we can do it
ourselves as a technique,

605
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:10,936
but nothing more. It's not reflex.

606
00:22:11,105 --> 00:22:12,671
There's a difference between using

607
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:15,400
a technique and just
naturally moving around.

608
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,931
So, let's get on with it.

609
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,074
People who are on 4.3 are essentially

610
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:24,483
players who cut corners while chasing you

611
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:26,359
among the rest of the times.

612
00:22:26,383 --> 00:22:28,500
While taking the inner walls like this,

613
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,936
they also use them as
cover while chasing you.

614
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:32,878
So you either have to keep running away

615
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:34,740
or open yourself up in order

616
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:36,143
to have them on your sights again.

617
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:39,752
Now, we'll talk more about
this in particular later,

618
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:43,001
but the level 4.3 almost always has

619
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:46,425
the level 4.1 or level 4.2 in it.

620
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,500
So when you get close to the guy,

621
00:22:48,524 --> 00:22:51,391
he's almost always going
to outstrafe you anyways.

622
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:53,852
Also, by always cutting corners,

623
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:55,781
if you stay put too much, he's going

624
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:57,381
to block your next exit

625
00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:59,491
and force you to go back the way you came.

626
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,119
He'll always put himself
in a certain position

627
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:05,364
from which he could block
all your paths completely.

628
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,926
And this is obviously especially

629
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,288
easy in a corner.

630
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:11,389
He just runs and blocks wherever you

631
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:14,039
were escaping to, and if
you try and fight him

632
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:15,641
he will outstrafe you.

633
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,037
This level already has so many perks to it:

634
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:22,434
pursuit ability, cover,
area control and denial,

635
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:24,176
not being able to outstrafe it,

636
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:25,916
and it outstrafing you.

637
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,776
And all you see while all
of this is happening,

638
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,796
is a person just running at you.

639
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,022
So with how tightly they take the corners,

640
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:36,128
your first instinct as a spy

641
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:37,509
is to try to cornerstab them.

642
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,492
But all that you'd find is that they

643
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:41,301
literally aimbot into you

644
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:42,741
as you are going for the stab.

645
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,850
No matter how fast, no matter how tight,

646
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:48,494
it just doesn't seem to
work out for you much.

647
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:50,215
This is the closest you'll ever ger

648
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,239
to this kind of person, so...

649
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:54,402
What really happens there, at the corner?

650
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:55,467
Why can't you stab him?

651
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:57,462
Well, look at where he's moving to.

652
00:23:57,489 --> 00:23:58,650
He's not following you,

653
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,710
he's following the road ahead of you,

654
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,267
so that he could stop you.

655
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,863
He expects to get to
you at any given point.

656
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:06,164
so he stays safe.

657
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:08,967
Whether you keep running
or stop at the corner,

658
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:12,504
these guys are masters
of going in at the right time.

659
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:15,273
Also, because he's taking the inner walls

660
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:18,036
on purpose, he's looking at the outer walls

661
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,692
while he does it. Meaning
he's looking at you,

662
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:22,314
however you're trying to stab him.

663
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,037
This is how they aimbot into you.

664
00:24:26,313 --> 00:24:28,179
But what does this remind us of when

665
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:29,528
they're cutting us off like this?

666
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:30,956
when they get to our side.

667
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:33,365
This reminds us of level 4, right?

668
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:35,046
Yeah, this is what happens when you

669
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:37,573
try to cornerstab them. They let you pass.

670
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,872
These people are simply
bypassing the corner

671
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:43,214
from the inside, so that they could

672
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,717
strafe across at you from that point.

673
00:24:47,206 --> 00:24:48,647
What you need to do against them

674
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:50,489
is to go for a level 4 stab

675
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,210
that will happen on the inner walls

676
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:54,186
where he's not looking, just as he starts

677
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,210
strafing across behind the corner.

678
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,111
And this stab is the "4.3 stab".

679
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,967
With the amazing strafes and all,

680
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,922
you have no chance of outstrafing him

681
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:07,299
out in the open like this, as you see here.

682
00:25:07,376 --> 00:25:09,508
But, once he's restricted

683
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:11,356
the inner wall of the corner

684
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:13,084
all of this changes.

685
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:15,488
Using this special level 4 stab,

686
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,289
you can fight these people.

687
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:18,817
Here's how it's done.

688
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,946
I'm running over to the left here,

689
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:22,934
and since I'm far away from the corner,

690
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,976
and he's practically behind it already,

691
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:27,592
he's going to go through just like this.

692
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:30,262
And I want you to remember
these arrows from now on,

693
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:32,591
because exactly when he goes in

694
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,841
is where you go for forwards and backwards

695
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:37,709
right after the corner.

696
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:40,105
So rather than a forwards
and backwards stab

697
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,141
from the outside of the
corner, it's from the inside,

698
00:25:43,297 --> 00:25:45,350
which is very counter-intuitive.

699
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:48,295
Don't just go for no-fancy matadors,

700
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,455
you're supposed to end up closer

701
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,168
to the inner wall than he does,

702
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:55,020
and you cut off him cutting you off.

703
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:58,323
All you have to do is to make sure

704
00:25:58,572 --> 00:26:00,311
that you're taking the corner wide enough

705
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:02,247
while backing off, to give the other guy

706
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,956
confidence in chasing you from the inside,

707
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,980
and not from the outside.

708
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:09,955
Now you see, a lot of people try to

709
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,224
cut you off and try to chase you quickly.

710
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:14,806
But there's a fundamental difference

711
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,282
between people who are just
running after you,

712
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,277
to the people on this level.

713
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:21,920
Taking corners tightly is
considered careless,

714
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:24,469
taking corners wide is considered smart,

715
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:27,218
but cutting corners is even smarter

716
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:30,262
than taking wide corners
in a lot of situations.

717
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:33,038
It's like taking wide
corners from the inside

718
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:35,794
so you gain time instead of losing time.

719
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:38,096
The speed of this level is what

720
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:39,556
makes it so powerful.

721
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,998
So again, this guy is gonna blast me away,

722
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,361
I'm all the way over there,

723
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,685
he's practically behind this turn already.

724
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,588
So he's gonna take it to the inner wall

725
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,116
instead of wasting time making it wide.

726
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,292
But again, I want you to
understand that at this point,

727
00:26:54,504 --> 00:26:56,504
there is no stab that's gonna work on him,

728
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:58,036
I can't just corner-matador him

729
00:26:58,061 --> 00:26:59,831
or C2C him or nothing.

730
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:02,180
I have to lure him to after the corner

731
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,289
that's where I can stab him.

732
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:07,766
It's rare for you to get
a stab on the corner,

733
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:10,215
a stab that actually looks like a matador,

734
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,997
because even if just by a little bit,

735
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:14,172
it will happen afterwards. Of course,

736
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:16,636
you might get a circlestrafe-ish
stab here and there,

737
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,129
especially if the guy is being

738
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:19,491
really careless against you.

739
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,321
But typically, if you go for a
matador on the corner,

740
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:24,910
you will either not let him pass through,

741
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,638
or he will get behind you.

742
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,042
The point of this stab is also not just:

743
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,196
"Oh, run away and then
 just come right back"

744
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:33,478
No no, that's not what it's about.

745
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:35,347
It's not about doing it at the right time,

746
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,949
it's about doing it at the right place,

747
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:39,864
and it's definitely not

748
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:41,888
always about changing directions.

749
00:27:42,432 --> 00:27:45,083
And that's because they're
not actually following you,

750
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:47,107
they're going to the rooms ahead of you.

751
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:49,148
Let's take a look at this here.

752
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:51,449
I started gesturing that I'm gonna go over

753
00:27:51,474 --> 00:27:53,044
to the right place over there.

754
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:54,859
Of course, he's gonna try to cut the corner

755
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,179
and get there before I do.

756
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:58,089
And in that particular case,

757
00:27:58,113 --> 00:28:00,358
I didn't really need to change directions

758
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:01,880
in order to stab him.

759
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:03,742
Changing directions is just the way

760
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,766
it works out a lot of the time.

761
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,225
Also, it's not always about

762
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,165
chasing you down, like this.

763
00:28:09,394 --> 00:28:11,069
It's about positioning, too.

764
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,366
All people eventually understand,

765
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:15,160
that it's more efficient the inside

766
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:16,955
of walls, instead of the outside,

767
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:18,823
for control over the entire area,

768
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,238
or just for outstrafing.

769
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:22,053
Sometimes though, if you know that

770
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,669
a player is especially aware
of his surroundings,

771
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:27,138
you can manipulate him into blocking you

772
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,545
from getting to some place on purpose,

773
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:31,237
and get an easy stab on him.

774
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:34,699
But again, it doesn't have
to happen like this.

775
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:37,348
Let's take a look at that
spy fighting this pyro,

776
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:38,950
and the pyro is already jumping

777
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:40,372
out of the other window,

778
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:42,594
trying to get there before the spy does.

779
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:44,482
He wasn't following him directly,

780
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:46,642
he was following the road ahead of him.

781
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:49,594
One way or another, he's going to keep

782
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:51,401
doing that against everyone.

783
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,719
Now, in theory, you can lure someone

784
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:57,068
who is cutting corners to go some place

785
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:58,850
before you so that you could lose him,

786
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:01,713
but in reality, he can just step right back

787
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:03,679
while cutting it, while you have to

788
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:05,068
round the whole thing over.

789
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:07,372
The mechanics of the corner make it

790
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,935
easy for him to just get to you again.

791
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,230
It's very hard to get away from someone

792
00:29:12,254 --> 00:29:14,038
who is a 4.3. As we said,

793
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:15,700
even if you suddenly change directions

794
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:17,055
as he's cutting the corner,

795
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:19,310
he is going to catch up with you again.

796
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:21,847
But this also works in your favor.

797
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:24,009
Because of how good the guy's strafe

798
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,311
actually is, you're going to have to

799
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:28,213
go for the early level 4 stab,

800
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,962
pretty much from this distance.

801
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,506
Now, that's definitely really really far

802
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,662
for a level 4 stab,
it's very counter-intuitive

803
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:39,317
to start it at this point.

804
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:41,514
But since they get to you faster

805
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:43,074
than what your intuition tells you,

806
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:46,398
it works out, and it's the
same for them too.

807
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:49,294
They don't feel that you'll
get close to them that soon.

808
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:52,590
Now, one of the most important things

809
00:29:52,615 --> 00:29:54,479
that you have to notice while fighting

810
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:56,008
a person who is on 4.3,

811
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:58,213
is which corners he can cut.

812
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,088
For example, this little turn here,

813
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,137
I was backing off and I had no idea

814
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,905
that spy was capable of cutting it,

815
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,660
it caught me completely off-guard.

816
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:07,569
But obviously, for the next times

817
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:09,284
I face him there, I need to be able

818
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,758
to remember and predict

819
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:13,354
that he's gonna do that
in that certain spot.

820
00:30:13,704 --> 00:30:15,523
Other than clean corners,

821
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,358
there are many many things

822
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,781
that you can cut, so to speak,
in this game.

823
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:21,843
Things that you can use or jump over,

824
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,610
to get to places faster.

825
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:24,752
Things that will put them

826
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:26,241
literally out of your reach.

827
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:29,037
A good way to notice when
somebody is on 4.3,

828
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,779
is to see that other than changing

829
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:33,608
rooms all the time, he keeps
jumping on things,

830
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,377
while moving, as a part of his movement,

831
00:30:36,594 --> 00:30:38,186
without disrupting the flow

832
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,782
of chasing you or fighting you.

833
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:42,657
It can be simple things like
jumping over gaps

834
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,692
in order to catch up to you faster,

835
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:47,148
or jumping straight up to those stairs

836
00:30:47,172 --> 00:30:49,172
to block the spy from running out there.

837
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:51,269
He's always jumping somewhere.

838
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,501
You need to figure out these spots

839
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:55,570
that the other player
is capable of cutting,

840
00:30:55,802 --> 00:30:57,672
then all you have to do is figure out how

841
00:30:57,696 --> 00:30:59,481
to counter him as he's doing it.

842
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,095
It could be just turns that are

843
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,597
not actually corners, like these stairs,

844
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:05,694
it could be jumping on props.

845
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:08,356
But some of these spots are not as obvious.

846
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,525
I'm fighting this pyro here, and

847
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,833
it seems innocent enough,

848
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,569
he is on 4.3, but I know that from behind,

849
00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:16,231
he's going to try to go around me.

850
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,580
I can get him with a nice
little reverse stab.

851
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:20,928
By the way, at the beginning
 of all of this,

852
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:22,952
he jumped over this little mountain,

853
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:25,427
to stick to the inner walls of this shack,

854
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,828
to prevent me from escaping to the left.

855
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,744
So because now I know that he

856
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:31,439
can do this rather freely,

857
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:33,608
I can predict it for the next time

858
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,632
and stab him right then and there.

859
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:39,059
So yeah, I know that this
guy jumps on these rails,

860
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:40,935
all I gotta do is give him the space,

861
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,390
and he goes through.

862
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:45,533
Now usually he doesn't come
down from the rails

863
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:47,287
while cutting it, so I can try

864
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:48,616
to jump on there with him,

865
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:51,085
and see if that'll work for me, maybe not.

866
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:54,028
Now, it's pretty hard to
stab him normally too,

867
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:55,383
while he's cutting the corner,

868
00:31:55,384 --> 00:31:57,812
so some people have to concentrate

869
00:31:57,837 --> 00:31:59,641
on the prop while jumping onto it.

870
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:01,869
If i can see that this guy isn't exactly

871
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:04,766
looking at me completely
while he's jumping on,

872
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,529
then I can maybe get a stab
differently over there.

873
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,772
But let's expand on this whole prop thing.

874
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:12,073
I wanna talk to you about

875
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,661
special kinds of props,

876
00:32:13,685 --> 00:32:15,897
I'm talking about an entire complex

877
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:18,132
that's used as a prop by the other player.

878
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:20,355
He's capable of using its inner walls

879
00:32:20,379 --> 00:32:22,107
in order to never lose you.

880
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:24,131
Like this huge shack for example

881
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:26,614
this spy can jump on all of its rails

882
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:29,899
and all of its sides, to catch
up to me at any time.

883
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:32,053
Obviously, I can still cut him off

884
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,373
like we've seen until now.

885
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:35,096
And you can get these stabs

886
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
on the other sides of these
corners as well.

887
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:38,933
Seems pretty normal,

888
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,795
but let's talk about this for a second.

889
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:43,884
I'm running to the left here,
and we know this spot,

890
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:46,828
we've already seen this shack
in this video before,

891
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:48,985
how someone can cut it and take the inside

892
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,372
of the wall there, to get to you faster,

893
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:53,128
because it's all corners in the end.

894
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,272
But most places like this

895
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,218
are things that you can actually climb on,

896
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,242
things that can separate you from the spy,

897
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:00,922
monitoring you from above,

898
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,946
while the spy is circling it.

899
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,605
So let's talk about these kinds of places:

900
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,894
a complex which they can

901
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,368
climb onto while chasing you.

902
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:10,965
Now, he's not coming down
after you, probably,

903
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:13,528
but he might not be that out of reach,

904
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:15,056
like he believes.

905
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:17,576
But in case he is, you can try to jump up

906
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
to the complex with him, trying

907
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,149
to stab him while you're both on it.

908
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:24,058
But if it's too high up there,

909
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,644
on some high-up complex, like these rocks,

910
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:28,668
then you have to catch them in the moment

911
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:30,938
in which they're jumping onto the complex.

912
00:33:30,963 --> 00:33:32,963
Before he gets out of reach, like this.

913
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:35,113
You have to cut him off as he climbs on,

914
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,809
don't jump up there before he does,

915
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:39,266
because then he's just going
to expect a propstab.

916
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,990
Get him in the spot in which he jumps up,

917
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,192
no matter how far away he is

918
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:46,216
while he's up there, and not coming down,

919
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,769
you get there from ground level,

920
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,471
which you pass by. That's
where you catch him.

921
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:53,748
Now, another option is when they come down.

922
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,617
But I told you that they
probably don't come down,

923
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,641
I mean, here I'm escaping to the left,

924
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:00,528
and this guy could stay close to the pillar

925
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:02,953
and attack me from above
while I'm escaping,

926
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:04,398
but he doesn't at this point,

927
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:05,507
he comes down to me.

928
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:07,247
Why does this happen?

929
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:09,237
Well, it's kinda simple.

930
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:11,467
Once you stop circling the complex,

931
00:34:11,492 --> 00:34:12,774
once you just leave,

932
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:14,896
it's when they come down. It's simple,

933
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,478
but usually, you try to stay under there

934
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:18,940
in order to stab them.

935
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,522
By stepping backwards, you
leave the corner system

936
00:34:21,546 --> 00:34:23,259
in which they're trying to control you.

937
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:25,193
Just stop waiting under there,

938
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:28,329
just walk backwards, gesture
that you're leaving.

939
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:30,164
That's how you lure them down.

940
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:35,310
Ok, so enough about the complex.

941
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,334
Back to just corners now.

942
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,754
There are people who don't stick

943
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,310
to the inner walls as
much as others obviously.

944
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:45,359
So, right now I wanna talk to you

945
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,101
about the person's abilities,

946
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,125
when it comes to cutting the corner.

947
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:52,100
This guy was cutting it just like this,

948
00:34:52,336 --> 00:34:55,055
across the bus, but at this point,

949
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,891
he could have gone
further backwards, right?

950
00:34:56,915 --> 00:34:58,007
He could have cut it again

951
00:34:58,032 --> 00:34:59,500
and stayed close to the bus.

952
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:01,362
Let's try to picture it.

953
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:02,784
This guy is taking the inside of

954
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:03,906
the corners, cutting them,

955
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,707
and at this point, he's
just like that scout,

956
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:09,077
he's gonna cut that corner, only that he

957
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:11,335
is really committed to this inner wall,

958
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,961
sticks in there, and he doesn't detach,

959
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:15,116
like that scout did.

960
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:17,285
This is how a stab with someone who sticks

961
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:18,626
to the bus could've looked like.

962
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,650
He was still backing up in there,

963
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
he was practically doing this.

964
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:25,133
Some people, like this guy

965
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:27,157
aren't really committed to the inner wall

966
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,169
like you expect him to, so

967
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:31,099
it might not be that obvious to you that

968
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:33,202
they're actually cutting the corner still,

969
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:34,642
and you might get baited into

970
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,023
going for a different stab.

971
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,419
Remember he can stick completely
to the inner walls,

972
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:40,908
but he can also take it closer to you.

973
00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:42,657
Kind of like strafing towards,

974
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:44,681
where some people gravitate more backwards,

975
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:46,561
and some people don't.

976
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:49,470
Obviously, the more backwards they pull,

977
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:50,671
the harder it becomes.

978
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,074
I predicted this guy would stay way closer

979
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:55,069
to me, but he sticks to the inner wall

980
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:57,405
and backs off way more than what I thought.

981
00:35:57,662 --> 00:35:59,662
Now that I know that he does it so much,

982
00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:02,416
instead of going for it like
he would run into me,

983
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,371
I know that he's gonna gravitate backwards

984
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,850
into that inner wall,

985
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,595
and I can just go straight over there.

986
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:09,811
It was close, and it didn't work out,

987
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,619
but that first try was nowhere

988
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:13,908
near as close to a stab,

989
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:15,436
as that second try.

990
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,358
And that's because by understanding

991
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,360
what he's capable of, I knew

992
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:20,902
how I should change how I move.

993
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:22,763
So maybe with this kind of person

994
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:25,091
that glues himself to the
inner wall like this,

995
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:26,908
maybe you wanna try to get the stab on him

996
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:29,130
right before he gets to that point.

997
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,153
But stabs that close to the inner wall

998
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:34,001
are still very hard for you

999
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:36,330
You really wanna find a way

1000
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:38,742
to lure them away from that inner wall

1001
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:39,854
and closer to you.

1002
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:42,403
So we talked about this before,

1003
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:44,218
maybe you wanna take a step back

1004
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,674
from the inner walls to
lure them closer to you.

1005
00:36:46,698 --> 00:36:47,869
You wanna find ways

1006
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:49,604
to make it easier for yourself.

1007
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:51,512
Also if they are on a different plane

1008
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:53,680
than you are, then they obviously feel safe

1009
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:55,396
and won't take it as tightly.

1010
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:57,311
Also, while jumping down

1011
00:36:57,336 --> 00:36:59,714
can control themselves that well.

1012
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:02,163
So most of the reasons are environmental

1013
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,045
and you can sometimes manipulate them.

1014
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:06,187
For example, by going for the stab

1015
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:08,264
in a place where there are hazards

1016
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:09,417
on the inner walls.

1017
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:10,872
Here, he's cutting corners

1018
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,868
and could have taken it closer to the wall,

1019
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:14,815
but then he would've gotten
stuck right under

1020
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,111
the stairs there, on the left, so

1021
00:37:17,428 --> 00:37:20,408
he naturally gets pulled
away from that wall

1022
00:37:20,432 --> 00:37:21,642
and more into you.

1023
00:37:22,071 --> 00:37:24,132
Now obviously, there could be other,

1024
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,194
more unortodox reasons

1025
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:28,069
for them to get pulled into you.

1026
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:30,324
But you should count on random events

1027
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,014
though, too much. Usually they just always

1028
00:37:33,038 --> 00:37:34,775
take it as tightly as possible,

1029
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:36,484
and it will always happen faster

1030
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:37,506
than what you expect.

1031
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:39,861
If you're not in some kind of special spot,

1032
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:42,152
the best you can do is really to

1033
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:45,172
figure out the optimal
timing and positioning

1034
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,668
for the next times against
that certain player.

1035
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:48,943
It's important to understand

1036
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,632
whether you change directions or not,

1037
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:52,346
to wait a little more than an inch

1038
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:53,793
after the corner or not.

1039
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:56,357
Figure out when the other player's strafe

1040
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:58,813
is vulnerable to this stab the most.

1041
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,588
Maybe if you don't wait enough,

1042
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,169
he not going through the corner,

1043
00:38:02,194 --> 00:38:03,831
maybe if you wait for too long,

1044
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:06,220
he'll start backing off after
cutting the corner.

1045
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,369
Maybe you should really plan ahead.

1046
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:10,057
If you see that he gets stuck

1047
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:12,082
on the inner walls while cutting corners,

1048
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,976
maybe hope for some
hazard on the inner walls

1049
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
will block him enough for you to stab him.

1050
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:19,523
Or really, maybe the guy is just

1051
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,156
really hard to outstrafe

1052
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,770
with longer strafes,

1053
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,705
so maybe you wanna try to juke

1054
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,207
behind the corner a little bit,

1055
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:28,135
and see if that will work on him.

1056
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,157
Just try to go about it differently,

1057
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:31,733
see which movements

1058
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,939
make him act the way you want him to.

1059
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,046
Alright, moving on.

1060
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:41,389
Right now I wanna talk to you specifically

1061
00:38:41,413 --> 00:38:44,045
about corners, and exactly when and why

1062
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:46,069
a person would be able to cut them.

1063
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:47,775
Let's take a look at this guy.

1064
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:49,550
He's gonna take the corner wide,

1065
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:51,966
and only then when he's sure of your

1066
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,990
positioning behind the corner,

1067
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,483
that's when he can cut it.

1068
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:57,671
In this situation, he can't cut it,

1069
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:59,513
he can't go through,
he's obviously going to

1070
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,228
stay back there and take it wide.

1071
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:03,110
So again, you have to open up

1072
00:39:03,153 --> 00:39:04,945
the space for him. If you go behind

1073
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,248
the corner completely,
he's going to have to peek,

1074
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,771
and only then, if he sees
that it's open for him,

1075
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,219
then he can cut it.

1076
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:14,822
Combined with the outstrafing and all,

1077
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,104
this level is about being really careful

1078
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:19,633
and really aggressive all at once.

1079
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:23,310
Now obviously, this means
that in situations

1080
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:24,993
when they're not cutting the corner,

1081
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,134
like here, you could get them

1082
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,988
 with the normal C2C stabs.

1083
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:31,872
Now, this next guy is going to be on 4.3.

1084
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:34,881
This corner is way too
tight for him to cut.

1085
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,851
Now, I know he likes staying behind

1086
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,392
corners when he's not sure.

1087
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,980
I knew he would back off.

1088
00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:42,295
So again, for people who are chasing you,

1089
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:43,738
and especially from far away,

1090
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:44,801
they're convinced that you're

1091
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:46,219
gonna try to come back through the corner

1092
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,597
and cornerstab them or something.

1093
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:49,150
So they're not going to cut it,

1094
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:50,811
they're going to take it normally.

1095
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:53,521
But once they see you behind the corner,

1096
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,825
that's the chance they have to cut it

1097
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:57,691
if they think you might escape.

1098
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,686
But when they don't have your

1099
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:01,594
exact positioning behind a corner,

1100
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:04,058
again they're either gonna peek through

1101
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:05,285
or take it wide.

1102
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:07,748
Of course, different people are going to

1103
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,904
have different distances from which

1104
00:40:09,928 --> 00:40:11,928
they're comfortable cutting corners.

1105
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:14,949
I was almost completely behind the corner

1106
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:16,991
with this scout and this medic,

1107
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:18,746
but they were still comfortable in

1108
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:20,368
taking the inside of the wall

1109
00:40:20,392 --> 00:40:21,776
to try and get to me faster.

1110
00:40:21,893 --> 00:40:23,437
Now of course, some people are

1111
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,119
not as comfortable doing this,

1112
00:40:25,143 --> 00:40:26,761
or the environment forces them to.

1113
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:28,422
This guy is taking the inner wall,

1114
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:30,177
but then he takes it wide for a second

1115
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:32,480
before taking the inner wall again.

1116
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:34,528
They're being more careful by doing this,

1117
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:36,552
but they're going to be a lot slower.

1118
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:38,577
At some point though, they
have to take it wide

1119
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,134
to actually see where you are,

1120
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:41,916
right before coming at you,

1121
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,212
all in the same motion.

1122
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:44,872
Of course there will be people

1123
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,694
who will cut the corner, then realize

1124
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:48,743
that they've got to close
and they'll back off.

1125
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,373
There are some people who cut corners

1126
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:54,822
without the intention of
cutting it to the end.

1127
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:56,824
Let's take a look at this guy.

1128
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,855
He chases me down and is about to

1129
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,708
jump on this prop in order to cut

1130
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:02,563
the corner and get to me faster.

1131
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,056
But once he realizes he got close enough,

1132
00:41:05,654 --> 00:41:07,654
then he just starts taking wide.

1133
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:10,070
Let's take a look at another example here.

1134
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:12,373
I know that this guy is on 4.3,

1135
00:41:12,397 --> 00:41:13,861
about to cut the corner,

1136
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,885
and then just sorta breaks off.

1137
00:41:16,295 --> 00:41:17,558
That's what he did over there,

1138
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:20,027
he came real close and
then he took it wide.

1139
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,223
Now, some people might break away

1140
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:23,991
because they got too close to you.

1141
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,066
Some people will do this

1142
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,515
even if you keep running away.

1143
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:29,539
This means that they might not fall for the

1144
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:31,563
4.3 stab after the corner,

1145
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
but it does mean that they keep their backs

1146
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,883
to the inner wall before the corner,

1147
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,380
and that maybe that's where
you should go for it.

1148
00:41:39,057 --> 00:41:40,701
So ok, to summarize,

1149
00:41:40,974 --> 00:41:42,763
a player on 4.3 would usually

1150
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:45,139
cut the corner, get up
there before you do...

1151
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:46,667
But at some points,

1152
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:49,781
he won't feel like he
has to or that he can.

1153
00:41:52,658 --> 00:41:54,475
It's mostly a way to pursue somebody

1154
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:56,063
to prevent him from leaving,

1155
00:41:56,087 --> 00:41:57,606
and once they've caught up to you

1156
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,630
that's when they start fighting normally.

1157
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:02,770
Usually, with either 4.2 or 4.1,

1158
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,172
creating this really amazing balance

1159
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:06,794
between staying really far,

1160
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:08,322
and then getting really close

1161
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:09,649
by cutting corners.

1162
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
Essentially with 4.3,

1163
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:14,283
usually you'd get other levels too.

1164
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,990
Let's take a look at his spy.

1165
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:17,765
I noticed that he's on level 4,

1166
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:20,307
but not quite, he's on level 4.2.

1167
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:22,516
So I decide to run away from him,

1168
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,998
to bet on the fact that he'll

1169
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:25,566
take the inside of the corner,

1170
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:28,722
that in addition to fighting with 4.2,

1171
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,365
he's going to pursue me with 4.3.

1172
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:33,988
Let's take a look at this scout.

1173
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,383
He's on 4.3, and he's able to cut corners

1174
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:37,705
in a pretty interesting way.

1175
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:39,640
When he sees me climbing the stairs,

1176
00:42:39,664 --> 00:42:42,517
he jumps up there to block
me from climbing up.

1177
00:42:42,886 --> 00:42:45,159
Now he takes it wide and
then cuts it again,

1178
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:47,101
stabbed from the inner wall.

1179
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,023
And here again, I could catch him

1180
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:50,271
as he's doing this,

1181
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,526
to get him with the 4.3 stab

1182
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,774
as he's jumping up there.

1183
00:42:54,384 --> 00:42:56,384
But when there are no corners,

1184
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,807
when I'm there, where he
feels like I'm not escaping,

1185
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:00,841
when he feels there is nothing to block me,

1186
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,603
he's gonna fight me, and he's gonna

1187
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:04,305
fight me with 4.1.

1188
00:43:04,556 --> 00:43:07,073
See this? He goes around
me, then he backs off.

1189
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,580
I get him with a nice glue-ish stab.

1190
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,366
So 4.3s typically have two levels,

1191
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,507
and the more he's committed

1192
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:15,256
to the 4.3 and the inner wall,

1193
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,057
the more you can try those stabs on him.

1194
00:43:17,247 --> 00:43:19,247
And the more he's committed
to his other levels,

1195
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:20,735
the more you can try those on him.

1196
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:22,303
It also depends on how safe

1197
00:43:22,328 --> 00:43:25,219
they feel chasing spies,
and on the situation.

1198
00:43:25,743 --> 00:43:27,374
Here I got the jump on this pyro,

1199
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:29,203
so he couldn't read the corners

1200
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:31,227
or where I was going to so well,

1201
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:33,741
so he moved with 4.1 as reflex.

1202
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:35,489
So even if they're very committed

1203
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:36,976
to the 4.3 strafes,

1204
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:39,800
when they're not in a
situation to cut corners,

1205
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:41,482
you can get them with the other stabs

1206
00:43:41,605 --> 00:43:43,718
that correspond with their other levels.

1207
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:45,508
That also means that after they've cut

1208
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:47,586
the corner and got stopped or something,

1209
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:49,523
they're still on level 4

1210
00:43:49,548 --> 00:43:50,551
you can still get them

1211
00:43:50,576 --> 00:43:51,852
those stabs as well.

1212
00:43:52,636 --> 00:43:55,296
Just a well timed manage-your-matadors

1213
00:43:55,537 --> 00:43:56,630
and there we go!

1214
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,477
Also, still being on level 4,

1215
00:44:01,502 --> 00:44:03,317
it means that they do all this stuff

1216
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,232
that level 4s really like doing.

1217
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,615
Like jumping at you from the corners,

1218
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:10,043
which you can time and
exploit to your advantage,

1219
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,986
or trying to jump over you

1220
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:13,520
on slopes or on the stairs.

1221
00:44:13,705 --> 00:44:15,872
If you can see that they're
doing this sort of thing,

1222
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:17,992
then you can get them like that as well.

1223
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,668
But actually moving on,

1224
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:22,843
one of the best ways to make them

1225
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:24,867
cut corners is by actually

1226
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:25,965
running away from them.

1227
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,195
By turning your back at them

1228
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,224
you convince them that
you're going to leave.

1229
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:31,825
Or that you are planning for something

1230
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,627
and you're gonna leave and come right back.

1231
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,811
And that's a golden opportunity for people

1232
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:37,664
to cut corners against you.

1233
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,208
That's because they know most players

1234
00:44:40,232 --> 00:44:42,232
don't expect them to be this fast.

1235
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,349
So, as you're running away normally,

1236
00:44:44,546 --> 00:44:45,960
you can just turn right back.

1237
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,096
And it works surprisingly well

1238
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,472
for people this aware and confident

1239
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:53,267
in their strafing, and of their

1240
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,019
understanding of pursuit.

1241
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,745
You can take advantage
of that really easily.

1242
00:44:57,968 --> 00:44:59,580
You can gesture, just like here,

1243
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:01,862
that you're going some place
with your back at them,

1244
00:45:01,886 --> 00:45:04,431
and that's just a golden
opportunity for them

1245
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,455
to try to get there before you do.

1246
00:45:06,732 --> 00:45:08,429
Still again, remember that this is not

1247
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:10,481
some surprise stab, it's not a matador.

1248
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:12,033
For example here, I know how

1249
00:45:12,058 --> 00:45:13,901
far behind me this pyro is, I know that

1250
00:45:13,926 --> 00:45:15,702
I don't even have to change directions.

1251
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:17,217
Because it's a stab that happens

1252
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:18,344
on the inner wall.

1253
00:45:18,888 --> 00:45:20,574
It's still the 4.3 stab.

1254
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:23,016
Obviously, still being the same stab,

1255
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:24,885
you can do it in reverse, and you can do it

1256
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,064
even before the corner, on the inner wall.

1257
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,896
You can play around with it.

1258
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,540
Now, speaking of playing it out,

1259
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:34,855
about overhead and underhead angles.

1260
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:36,879
Remember this perk for every level:

1261
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:38,525
the fact that you're going for a stab

1262
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:40,380
from below or from above

1263
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,676
does not change the nature of the stab.

1264
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,970
See where this guy turned?

1265
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:45,232
Whether I jump or not,

1266
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:47,027
I should go for a stab that takes

1267
00:45:47,052 --> 00:45:49,443
into account him cutting the corner,

1268
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:50,818
you know, obviously.

1269
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,093
So yeah, you know. You jump and

1270
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:54,475
take into account that

1271
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:57,157
he takes the inside of a
corner and all of that.

1272
00:45:57,947 --> 00:45:59,426
But there's something more to it,

1273
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:01,887
I found that if a person cuts the corner

1274
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:04,071
while on different planes that you,

1275
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,246
especially if he was behind a wall

1276
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:07,728
or something while he was cutting it

1277
00:46:07,886 --> 00:46:09,115
to get to you faster,

1278
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:11,925
you're going to be able to
outstrafe him easily

1279
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:14,668
for how much he gravitates towards you

1280
00:46:15,026 --> 00:46:17,210
while cutting on different
planes like this.

1281
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,027
So now for the understabs.

1282
00:46:22,131 --> 00:46:24,086
So obviously it can work exactly like

1283
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:26,480
you'd think, you lure them
into one direction

1284
00:46:26,504 --> 00:46:28,275
and then you go forwards and backwards,

1285
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,810
and yeah it could work like that.

1286
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:31,578
Could also happen when they're

1287
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:33,602
jumping on props to get to you faster,

1288
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,682
nothing new here.

1289
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:37,831
But then again, let's take

1290
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:39,566
a look at one of these understabs.

1291
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:41,889
This guy just drops straight down

1292
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
in an attempt to drop down safely,

1293
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,260
ends up getting stabbed anyways.

1294
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,710
Now, some people only drop down like that,

1295
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,211
but let's try to connect all this

1296
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:53,033
to what we know about this level

1297
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:54,100
for a second.

1298
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:56,717
When a guy on 4.3 does this,

1299
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:58,032
there's a reason to it

1300
00:46:58,057 --> 00:46:59,586
other than just staying safe.

1301
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,483
It's because you moved towards some room

1302
00:47:02,507 --> 00:47:04,311
that under him and behind him.

1303
00:47:04,377 --> 00:47:06,994
So he drops down and then he backpedals

1304
00:47:07,018 --> 00:47:09,018
in order to block you from getting there.

1305
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:10,911
They're cutting the corner vertically

1306
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:12,244
instead of horizontally.

1307
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,275
So those stabs that seem simple

1308
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,783
are pretty much the same

1309
00:47:16,808 --> 00:47:18,553
as this 4.3 stab.

1310
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,440
How they look in the end depends

1311
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:22,002
on where they start.

1312
00:47:22,026 --> 00:47:23,403
These last two players both

1313
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:25,167
wanted to drop down and

1314
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:26,687
block me from getting to the health.

1315
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:28,402
All they did is keep themselves

1316
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:30,250
to the inner wall of the turn

1317
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,186
which they were taking. In the case of

1318
00:47:32,211 --> 00:47:33,791
dropping down, this is just the

1319
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:35,306
way it happens sometimes.

1320
00:47:35,331 --> 00:47:36,757
So when you see someone dropping

1321
00:47:36,781 --> 00:47:38,091
straight down after you

1322
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:40,307
it might be because he was a 4.3.

1323
00:47:40,445 --> 00:47:41,922
But obviously, of course,

1324
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:43,557
depending on where you're moving to,

1325
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:45,913
they could jump some place
completely different

1326
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:47,935
to try and stop you from getting there.

1327
00:47:48,552 --> 00:47:50,549
And that just about wraps it up,

1328
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:52,893
sort of...

1329
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:55,909
We've learnt a lot in this section,

1330
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:58,839
and this is the last of the
amazing levels 4.'s.

1331
00:47:58,936 --> 00:48:00,787
This is the last consistent form

1332
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:02,282
of movement in this game.

1333
00:48:02,306 --> 00:48:04,004
But for me, that just means we've

1334
00:48:04,029 --> 00:48:05,272
covered all the basics,

1335
00:48:05,297 --> 00:48:06,700
things that every player,

1336
00:48:06,724 --> 00:48:08,035
in my opinion, should know.

1337
00:48:08,372 --> 00:48:10,791
Next part is the last part, I promise.

1338
00:48:10,874 --> 00:48:12,266
It's about using this knowledge

1339
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,307
about movement that

1340
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:14,666
we learnt while playing.

1341
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,103
And it's also in my opinion,

1342
00:48:16,128 --> 00:48:17,938
the most important part, so...

1343
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:19,833
You've already gotten this far,

1344
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:21,275
I'll see you there.
