1
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,967
Hey there.

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,912
So I'm here to talk to you
about stabbing knife work.

3
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:41,180
It's fancy and everything, but it's mostly
a pubby thing to do on unaware players.

4
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:44,336
You'd usually get into
a bad situation with

5
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:47,676
a weary player and not be
able to do the same thing.

6
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,521
But really, I found
that all of this is just

7
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:53,622
because stabbing really
stopped developing at one point.

8
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:57,662
Making a lot of old techniques
seem silly nowadays.

9
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:02,578
And a lot of spies have tossed
aside stabbing altogether.

10
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:06,873
But back then I found this one spy.

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,911
Watching his videos at the time
was just something amazing.

12
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:14,896
I saw him getting himself
into one of these situations.

13
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:17,790
But he managed to pull through.

14
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,412
With something I
couldn't understand.

15
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:23,773
I asked him what it
was, and he told me,

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,400
Circle strafe stab.

17
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,460
That was a long time ago. Nowadays, a lot
of people know about it, and have been

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,750
doing it themselves. But there are a lot
of things that I haven't seen out there

19
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,830
things that would solve all of our
problems, and the things that people just

20
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:56,250
don't know. So I put together this entire
series of tutorials to just get it all out

21
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,621
there. It's everything I know.

22
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:06,005
Well, now, before learning
how to do circle strafing,

23
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,130
we need to understand why we actually need
it. I mean, we already have this perfectly

24
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:17,079
good ground level technique at our
disposal. Why do we need another one? As

25
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:21,570
it turns out, there are some special
reasons for it? Well, when you go for a

26
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,580
matador and the guy follows you with W he
follows you this way, and he gets stabbed.

27
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,930
That's what pretty much happens in a
nutshell. Now when someone is strafe

28
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,270
running at you, he's holding the W key,
but he's also holding a strafe key, it

29
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,760
makes him cut the turn to get to the same
place as he would have before just with W.

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,040
And he gets to you just a little faster
this way. But what it also means is that

31
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,360
once you strafe back, he's too far away
from you to actually stab.

32
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,993
Now, in addition to all of this,

33
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:58,560
there's him aiming at you.
And since a strafe key has

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,480
been added to this whole aiming equation,
it means that they have to move their

35
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,266
mouse less than if they were using purely
the mouse to aim at you.

36
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,738
Now this is hardly strafe aiming

37
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:14,040
and we'll get to that later.
But what this means is that

38
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,230
even if you run at them and get close
enough, they don't turn enough the right

39
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,816
timing to get stabbed to get matadored.

40
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,090
Now it didn't look to
the both of you, like

41
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,194
the stab should have worked, but in
reality, it was just out of reach.

42
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,535
The other player doesn't
even have to really think about it

43
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,273
just by the fact that
he's strafing at you.

44
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:38,657
You can't normally matador him.

45
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,105
It still somewhat works on,

46
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,930
players who are inconsistent with their
strafe or just have very poor strafes,

47
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,182
which is why matadors can still work, but
mostly on pubs and not even that much.

48
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:56,304
But in addition to
all of that I found that,

49
00:03:56,924 --> 00:04:01,051
circle strafing does work
on these exact players.

50
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:04,534
I didn't know what it
was, but it just seems

51
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:07,360
like when you'd usually
go for a matador and fail,

52
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:10,617
we'd go for a circle
strafe and win.

53
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:13,870
It can get really,
really close, but,

54
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:18,960
you still won't get it, which is
why I've come to these conclusions.

55
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:23,201
Against a player who has a
consistent and good strafe.

56
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,185
No matter how much you try,

57
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:29,207
you won't be able to stab him
by leading him into a matador.

58
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:33,813
But I found that these
exact flaws that this stab has,

59
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:36,332
are the exact
gains of the other.

60
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,216
This is my solution.

61
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:44,970
But it's not that simple. It's
not just a technique to replace Matadors,

62
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:49,955
by experimenting, I found that there's a
lot more behind all this.

63
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,456
So let's get started.

64
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,110
Well if you want me to explain
the execution all in one sentence,

65
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,142
strafe in one direction,

66
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,496
and eventually stab.

67
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:05,889
That's it.

68
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:10,026
But no one would really need any
explanation if it were that simple.

69
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:12,284
For example, one thing
that confuses a lot of

70
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:15,338
people about this
stab is this very idea.

71
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,018
There's no deception,

72
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,773
you don't change directions,
you only go one way.

73
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,950
Hell sometimes you even move
across some wall or across something.

74
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:26,390
Which makes it even
more predictable. So...

75
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:28,616
How can it even work?

76
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:32,370
Now you probably
already know this, but circle

77
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,140
strafing only works on people who are
strafing. And strafing has a lot of things

78
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,400
to it that you might not know about, like
understanding that strafing can also be a

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,960
form of running, as opposed to what you'd
usually think strafing is, strafing has a

80
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,340
lot of forms to it. So before we talk
about the stab, I want to talk about

81
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,832
strafing itself and how it can relate to
spy.

82
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,866
Personally, I think it's crucial to

83
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,627
understand the mechanics of
movements before trying to exploit them.

84
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:01,739
So... there we have it.

85
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,640
By the end of this next section, you're
not supposed to know how to pull the

86
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,960
stab. It's just explaining a mechanic. But
really now this is something I've been

87
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,680
wanting to talk about for a long time.
It's always been there and you can see it

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,180
yourself. But it's something that I wanted
to explain. You usually only notice when

89
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,340
you slow it down, but let's say you got
a circle strafe stab, the guy you stab the

90
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,130
while it was happening flicks his view at
you and then away from you in this weird

91
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,078
kind of way. Why does this happen?

92
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:35,556
It always happens with
all of them. So I know

93
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,990
it's not like it's one crazy guy
spazzing his mouse all over the place.

94
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,260
And it's not like they're aimless, and
they can't look at you straight. So they

95
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,490
have to look too much at you, and then
away from you again like this. It's none

96
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,504
of that. So what is it?

97
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,576
Let's take a look at this
guy while he's strafing,

98
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,803
trying to understand
what's going on.

99
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,890
Now as he strafing, he
has to obviously move his

100
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,354
mouse to stay on target
as well, he moves in an

101
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:06,370
arc, creating that semi
circle ish kind of movement.

102
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:11,610
Now if his target moves, this
motion repeats itself as you move

103
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,960
your mouse back and forth. And this is
what we're seeing here. This is a core

104
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,879
mechanic of strafing which
makes it possible, I call it adjusting.

105
00:07:22,636 --> 00:07:26,978
Now average players will
adjust at you at least at two points,

106
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:28,992
the first being when they spot you.

107
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:31,045
Looks at you and
then looks away.

108
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:35,454
And the second being when you
get real close to them, looks away.

109
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,610
This last moment is the
crucial point of your circle strafe.

110
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,053
That point determines whether you get
behind him,

111
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:46,789
or he gets behind you.

112
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:50,521
It's not like was trying to get
behind you, you're just running at him.

113
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:53,128
And you're forcing
one of these two results.

114
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,800
So essentially, every
circle strafe turns

115
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,224
into this battle of
who gets behind who.

116
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,176
Now when he does
get behind you, it'll

117
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,289
just look like he was
looking at you very naturally.

118
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:07,560
But you have to remember
that after he looks at you,

119
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:12,330
and he's out of your view,
he has to look back creating

120
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,931
that semi circle kind of movement,

121
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:18,723
what you're doing is practically
cutting them off mid circle.

122
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:22,836
It's not called circle strafe stab
because you move around in

123
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,450
circles, sometimes, I think you'll find
that those are the worst stabs you'll get.

124
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,880
It's called circle strafe stab because the
other player that you're facing is using

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,442
circling motions. He's adjusting.

126
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,346
Let's take a look at
this pyro here. I go for a

127
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,510
stab on him and he gets really far behind
me and even air blasts. The next time I

128
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,070
try the same thing and this time, he gets
behind me again. But since he just looked

129
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,910
at me, he has to look back. And since
I'm still moving, I can still slip by.

130
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:57,035
This is how circle strafe
stab essentially exploits,

131
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,400
the other player having
to adjust to look at you.

132
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:03,205
This is why it makes sense for
people who just turned that you,

133
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,870
to turn away.

134
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:09,305
This is what makes it possible for
you to stab someone even though you're

135
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,890
moving only in one direction. Unlike the
spasms for people who are just running at

136
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,900
you with W that only depends on how you're
moving the spasms of a person who is

137
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,910
strafing happen for a reason. And
regardless of what you're doing, they also

138
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,810
happen without the player knowing about
it. For example, this guy complained about

139
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,045
running out of mouse space about running
out of wire while tracking me.

140
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,013
Now of course he
doesn't realize that at the

141
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,840
last moment, he was
actually swinging his mouse

142
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:37,887
away from me.

143
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:42,840
Now this happens all the time.
And this is why people can get very

144
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,770
confused when you circle strafe them.
One moment you're on their view and the

145
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,495
next moment is a blur.

146
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:51,135
Usually happens very fast too.

147
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:52,806
I mean when you strafe your

148
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,240
fingers predict that the guy you're
tracking will stay in front of you. I mean

149
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,282
that's the whole point.

150
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:01,536
For you it's just natural
aim you don't notice yourself

151
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,113
spazzing like this, you're
just trying to look at the spy,

152
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:07,050
and keep good distance from him.

153
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:14,050
New topic.

154
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:18,060
I'll explain more about it later.
But this stab is about gravity.

155
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,210
People gravitate towards you while this
stab happens, but some people just don't.

156
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,410
Some people will just keep strafing in
some other ways, and stay away from you

157
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,850
like that. We'll get to those later. Right
now we're focusing on people who can avoid

158
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,650
your circle strafe by
getting this to happen.

159
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:40,788
First of all, when you see this happening,
you know that you're on the right track.

160
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:44,656
But there are some things that you
need to keep in mind before you get it.

161
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:53,272
So okay, now finally, after all of that,
we are going to learn how to pull the stab.

162
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,940
Now first and foremost,

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,164
I can't stress this enough, you have
to keep strafing in the same direction.

164
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:05,940
Even if on your first swing, it doesn't
register. That's because you can't see the

165
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,160
slight differences in angles in real time
play. But still, you can't change

166
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,945
directions, you know
what's going to happen.

167
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,993
If you're gonna suddenly go for a
matador, you just have to keep going.

168
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:20,700
And now for the
strafe itself, I want to

169
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,380
emphasize that this stab is not a quick
stab, you don't just run at a person's

170
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:27,496
side and expect to stab them.

171
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:30,510
What you're going to do,
you're going to take a wide circle,

172
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,757
you're going to leave them the
space to strafe sideways into you.

173
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:37,543
But not even that is enough,

174
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,750
people also gravitate backwards
while strafing into you.

175
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:45,174
So this is the spot that you
should be aiming for while strafing.

176
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:47,723
It's to his side and behind him.

177
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:51,382
I'll explain more about this
later. But every circle strafe,

178
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:54,202
eventually gravitates backwards.

179
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:58,350
The circle strafes you would
usually think of where you spin

180
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,550
around in circles. And eventually stab
the guy happen mostly on people who

181
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,020
are strafing but they're not doing it very
well. They're doing it mindlessly and are

182
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,726
practically just
running at us. So...

183
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:11,438
I want you to forget
about these stabs.

184
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,958
Because they're mostly
not worth mentioning.

185
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:19,741
If you try to pull a circle strafe on
anyone normal, he pulls back eventually.

186
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:22,283
You have to be patient,
you have to be passive.

187
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,821
The last time I faced
this guy, I got impatient,

188
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,436
and I use W to try
to get to his back.

189
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:30,856
But at that point he pulled
back and got behind me.

190
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:33,500
Now sometimes people
strafe at you but they

191
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:36,420
don't get very close, which
can make them look smart

192
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,160
sometimes. But if they're not adjusting to
look at you right away, it just means that

193
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,200
they're missing you. If they try to aim at
you which they should, they will gravitate

194
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,970
sideways into you. And if they're not
adjusting straight away to try to get you

195
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,507
in front of them, it just
means that they lost you.

196
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,986
Good players will instantly
make a sideways strafe,

197
00:12:57,203 --> 00:13:00,540
to try to get you in front of
them, like so. And I want you do

198
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,340
remember this arrow, the stab happening is
just a matter of you out strafing them

199
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:06,953
while this happens.

200
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:10,860
Now one thing that's kind of
weird about circle strafing, and

201
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,910
it's also kind of off putting about it is
that you have to keep moving in the same

202
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,170
direction all the time. And that could
make you an easy target, right? If you

203
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,690
keep moving in the same way all
the time, you're gonna get shot down.

204
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,230
This is pretty far from
what actually happens.

205
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,505
Now the thing is, you
don't just start strafing

206
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,430
in one direction from far away when the
guy is still shooting and aiming at you.

207
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,960
You move side to side, you dodge you
do your thing. And when you get close,

208
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:39,226
that's when it happens.

209
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,910
You still dodge until
the last moment.

210
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,596
But now if you get tempted,

211
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:47,220
to click for a matador while
dodging, you might miss your chance to

212
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,837
swing for the circle strafe later.

213
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:53,588
Switching to your gun after
stabbing is a good habit.

214
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:57,510
But if you go for the wrong stab,
you might miss your chance for the

215
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,590
right stab. And you really don't want to
miss stabs because of things like this.

216
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,963
Not having your knife out when
you should or just miss clicking.

217
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,185
Let's take a look at this scout.

218
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:10,290
He has really good aim and if I
don't try to dodge, he's going to shoot

219
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,230
me down. And while strafing, I get baited
to click for a matador on him. Obviously

220
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,550
it didn't work but luckily I kept strafing
which gave me the stab on him afterwards.

221
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,410
Sometimes though, it's going to look like
your only option here I had no space and I

222
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,180
knew that he would run at me for a second
by reflex but none of that means I can

223
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,991
Matador him. Luckily I keep strafing and
get the circle strafe on him later.

224
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,092
But this is all
this is, it is luck.

225
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:40,650
My point is that usually
if you're going to start

226
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,520
going left and right and you click for a
matador, it's not going to end well for

227
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,045
you. You might get
it but it'll just be lucky.

228
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:50,590
You're going to have to teach
yourself how to dodge cleanly,

229
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:52,625
and click only for
the correct stab.

230
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:55,272
You can change the
directions from far away,

231
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:58,490
to dodge or to position
yourself better. And that's it.

232
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,210
For example, these next two clips, I'm
going to run at those pyros to close the

233
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,729
distance between us. So I could go
for a better circle strafe on them.

234
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:08,800
I don't click for any matadors.

235
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,090
It's a wide open space, and
I want to close the distance.

236
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:15,690
Optimally, you just want to go
in one direction and get the stab

237
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,230
immediately. But let's take a look at this
soldier, I'm going to strafe right and

238
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,730
left in front of him. But I'm not even
going to put my dead ringer down.

239
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,610
Because I know
that I'm not clicking,

240
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,685
until he strafes back into me.

241
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:30,727
You just need to
know what you're doing.

242
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:35,487
Now strafing in the same direction
for so long requires a lot of space.

243
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,820
And a lot of the times you're
going to bump into the walls around you,

244
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,170
which would cause you to fail the stab,
even touching the wall a little bit for a

245
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,850
second can deny you the stab. So just
don't go for it next to the walls, right?

246
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,690
Well, wrong, there are walls everywhere in
this game. And this happens because you

247
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,069
feel like you're about to get the person
right before you bump into something.

248
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:59,709
This also happens because some
people are going to react way later,

249
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,280
than what you expect, which
is going to mess up your angle.

250
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:06,480
Very rarely will you
both get to the wall at

251
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,782
the same time for you to stab.

252
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,960
For example, I expect this guy to
strafe straight sideways into me.

253
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,069
But he does it a little
later and he is strafing

254
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:17,669
across the wall right now.

255
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:19,960
And I just barely get him.

256
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,476
So this is another excuse
for you to change directions.

257
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:27,965
I'm gonna go for a stab on this pyro
here, it's not going to work for me,

258
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,776
and I'm about to
bump into the wall. So...

259
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,050
When you're going
for the stab, if you

260
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,090
find yourself headed towards some kind of
wall or hazard, change directions don't

261
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,274
fight for it, you're much better
off going for another angle.

262
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,986
Now other than the walls,

263
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,331
I want to talk to you about the
upsides and downsides to circle strafing

264
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,104
which you're going to
have to keep in mind.

265
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:56,190
Now a definite upside
to circle strafing,

266
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,415
which you're going to see,

267
00:16:57,537 --> 00:17:00,883
is that you get to avoid
flames. While the stab happens.

268
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:05,250
You stay on the edge or outside
of the players's view until the last

269
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:10,367
moment. This happens because of how
the stab works. You start out on his left.

270
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:12,966
And because you're
both moving to the left,

271
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:15,876
you stay on his left
and because of how

272
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,010
flames work in this game, you don't get
hit by them. Now this means that you can

273
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,840
have flameless circle strafes literally
even with the spycicle. And it's also

274
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,947
great for situations in which
you start out with low health.

275
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,510
Now obviously this is not absolute.

276
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,690
Through the adjustments and
the pyro's, general aim, he can still

277
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:38,550
hit you. But the thing is that he gets you
a lot less, which can save you, you can't

278
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,350
really make him miss all of it every time.
But getting hit a little little is a lot

279
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,010
better than getting
hit by all of it.

280
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,496
Lets take a look at this
situation right here I

281
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,620
get flamed really hard, the health is not
gonna be there. And I want you to look at

282
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,690
my health. Just as I start circle
strafing. I was already on fire, but I

283
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,420
only took after burn damage, I didn't get
hit by any more flames. Now another

284
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,410
awesome perk for when you're circle
strafing is that in addition to maybe

285
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:13,200
missing some of the flames, a pyro might
also miss the air blast. I'll explain in

286
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,210
more detail about how you can attempt for
this to happen later. But for now, I want

287
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,057
to talk to you about the
downsides of circle strafing.

288
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:24,538
Although powerful against flames,

289
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:29,635
it's weak against melee weapons,
and that's for the exact same reasons.

290
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,226
You stay on the edge
of his view the entire time

291
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:35,608
and a melee weapon's
range is very wide.

292
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:39,695
So even though you're
technically outstrafing them, since they

293
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,180
see you until the last moment, they are
going to hit you first. And it's very,

294
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,942
very easy for them to do it.

295
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,758
So while playing, you have
to get this into your head,

296
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:54,180
they are going to hit you first. It
doesn't matter if you're already behind

297
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,440
them. Doesn't matter how far you are
behind them. You are getting hit. So you

298
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,790
have to start taking this into account
while going for the stab.

299
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:06,018
You got to watch out for
things like jarate or random crits.

300
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:08,081
When you're faced
with a one hit kill.

301
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,966
You have to sort of plan it out.

302
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:13,779
Here I use the elevation from
the stairs to get him to miss me.

303
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:16,767
Playing it out like this isn't
always an option though.

304
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,374
Let's take a look
at these medics.

305
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,154
This guy's strafing so I have
to circle strafe him, I get hit first.

306
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,890
Let's take a look at this
other medic. I can't matador him. He's

307
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:31,123
also strafing so I think to myself, Okay,
maybe he won't to hit me. But he does.

308
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:36,720
You should never bet on him not hitting you
because he will it's too easy for him to

309
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,400
do this. Sometimes you'll get like a one
in a million he didn't hit you stab

310
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,520
about. Those are very, very rare. So you
got to take all of this into account. For

311
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,170
example, me and this pyro just playing here
a little. I just feel the circle strafe

312
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,943
let's see what we can pull here. A matador
would not work and we know why.

313
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:02,584
I could try to circle strafe him again.
But at this point, if he hits me, I'm dead.

314
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,131
So...

315
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,980
You just gotta keep all
of that in mind as you go.

316
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,720
Now, in a nutshell how strafing works is
that the guy sees you and tries to aim at

317
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,268
you, and he moves sideways until you are
at the center of his screen.

318
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:23,805
Now, if you keep moving
left while he's going left,

319
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:26,198
then you're going
to stay on his left.

320
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,493
This is how the stab works.

321
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:32,610
That's what I mean, when
I say that in circle strafing,

322
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,119
you stay on the edge, or right in
front of the guy, until the last moment.

323
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:41,950
It's because of this concept of staying at
his side. And the concept of adjusting,

324
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,877
that this stab is possible.

325
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:47,400
You can actually still get shot
the moment before you get it.

326
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:54,090
Now the reason that this happens is
because that's what happens from far away

327
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,343
too. He moves left and I move left, then
he backs up and he shoots me down.

328
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:00,603
And all of that is going
to keep happening.

329
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:05,303
He moves left and I move left and he
backs up and tries to shoot me down.

330
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:07,561
But that time I got closer.

331
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:10,862
Now when you are circle strafing
and the guy is strafing at you,

332
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:14,006
he's going to feel like he's
going to keep seeing you.

333
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:17,004
And you're going to feel
like you're going to stab him.

334
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:20,424
In reality, it's only the
last moment that counts.

335
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,939
People can't calculate
or realize it from this distance.

336
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:29,700
Look at this guy, he strafes at me
and then he strafes away, which makes it

337
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,320
look like he avoided it. But in reality,
he just sort of missed he didn't strafe

338
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,346
enough to get me in front of him and
had to correct himself the next time.

339
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:42,810
My point is with all of this is
that if people get this close to you.

340
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:46,107
They're going to get
that close to you as well.

341
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:53,517
Okay, so I've been wanting
to get this off my chest.

342
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,370
strafing, is in the person's reflex. Even
if you're tricking him into running into

343
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,896
you, he's still going to be strafing the
way he's used to, only less carefully.

344
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,745
You can't go for a matador,

345
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,395
just because you play it out,
just because he's running at you.

346
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:12,410
Because you did it in reverse. Or
because of anything really.

347
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:16,273
Strafing, strafing
towards is a part of reflex.

348
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:21,383
Or at least in the reflex of the people
that I want to talk about in these videos.

349
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:25,586
See this guy? I'm gonna fail
and get in front of him by surprise.

350
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:28,521
It's not like he will
suddenly stop strafing.

351
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:30,481
It's still like this,

352
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:35,235
I can't matador him right now, as
counter-intuitive as it might be.

353
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,193
All right, now...

354
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:43,440
I think we noticed that when the
person is moving sideways to get you in

355
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,570
front of him, he's not always moving in
the same way. There are different angles

356
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,580
for strafing towards. First we got
strafing forwards for people who are

357
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,200
running at you with their melee. And then
we got strafing sideways, usually just for

358
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,500
aiming at you, unlike with strafing
forwards when people are strafing

359
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,700
sideways, they're not trying to get to
you. That's not why they get stabbed,

360
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,900
they're trying to get you to be in front
of them. When people are strafing

361
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,910
sideways, it's like you two are on
different planes or platforms. They are

362
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:20,040
okay with their position, they didn't want
to get any more closer to you. And there's

363
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,360
also no point in getting further away.
Now, this has nothing to do with any

364
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,160
actual platforms really, it just happens
from a certain distance. See this, I'm up

365
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,830
here. He's down there. He's okay with it.
But I just ran down to his side. They're

366
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,570
forming a line of fire. And what you're
doing is you're cutting that line midway.

367
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,850
You run into them to get them to run into
you. Essentially that is how circle

368
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:51,750
strafing works. Also, please remember that
when I say a line of fire, I don't

369
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,490
actually mean a line. It's a bunch of semi
circles with adjusting and all sorts of

370
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,830
other stuff in it. But just to simplify
it, we're calling it a line. But still

371
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:07,980
obviously this line of fire suggests that
strafing sideways that strafing towards is

372
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:13,020
strafe aiming, but that's not the case.
Strafe aiming is just consciously

373
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:18,180
adjusting less, for better or worse.
Whether you try to keep yourself steady or

374
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,650
you move your mouse around to aim you're
still bound by the rules of adjusting and

375
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,730
the rules of strafing towards
definitely not everyone you've seen here

376
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,380
so far is strafe aiming. We've seen people
here strafing with their melee, we've

377
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,566
seen them strafing
with a flame thrower,

378
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,293
and we're also going to
see them backing off with it.

379
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,550
This is the last angle for strafing
towards strafing backwards.

380
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,200
You've all seen it people try to get away
from you. They end up running into you.

381
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:51,090
This time around they're hitting the
strafe key and the S key. Now that's what

382
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,720
happens in a nutshell. But in reality,
you remember that they're moving their

383
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,328
mouses around and adjusting and all of
that, just trying to simplify it.

384
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:03,487
Now when people are
strafing backwards, they're

385
00:25:03,512 --> 00:25:06,826
obviously pulling more
backwards than they are sideways.

386
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:11,100
Meaning that you also have
to pull more backwards than sideways.

387
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,970
Now usually you don't want to do that
because they can strafe sideways and get

388
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,630
behind you. That's why in circle strafing,
you don't take shallow strafes, you take

389
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,770
wide strafes sideways strafes. But for
this, you're going to have to take a

390
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,961
shallower strafe, a
circle that's almost a line.

391
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:30,748
To get more to the space behind them,
rather than to the space to their side.

392
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,980
Now speaking of shallow strafes, a

393
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,300
lot of your failed, matadors can turn into
strafing backward stabs because the

394
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,231
strafe of matador is
so shallow to begin with.

395
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:47,032
Also, it makes sense for people to back up
after they've seen you go left and right.

396
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:50,306
Though you still don't want
to click for the matador.

397
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,300
Now, when people
are strafing backwards, and they see that

398
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,500
you're staying on them, they might start
strafing sideways to try and fight you.

399
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,730
Also, even though you're just moving in
one direction, they might see differently

400
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,050
from you. And that means that they can
strafe sideways or forwards just to try

401
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,970
to aim at you. Usually though, they keep
backing up and it's up to you to lead them

402
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,740
and to strafe correctly
in order to get them.

403
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,586
And in the end getting a
guy while he's backing up,

404
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:21,106
might not be as
hard as it sounds.

405
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:26,739
Now, this line that I'm talking
about works in a lot of ways.

406
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:30,834
And I want to talk to you about what
happens when this line succeeds.

407
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:35,766
Now listen closely, because this is
where we really learn how to do this stab.

408
00:26:36,371 --> 00:26:39,060
Now first off, it succeeds
usually because you miss

409
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,201
predicted the angle in which
the guy is going to strafe at you.

410
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,600
This arrow that I paste
over these situations,

411
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:49,146
It can mean strafing
forwards. And it can also

412
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,430
mean strafing sideways
and backwards.

413
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:55,198
Meaning that it could look the
same at first but end differently.

414
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,590
Usually you'd predict more
of a forwards angle, or you'd

415
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,210
miss predict how soon he'd start strafing
backwards, or how good his backward

416
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,370
strafe really is, which would cause you
to fail the stab. Now you failing the stab

417
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:13,440
is just one instance of where this line
succeeds. That's not where things end.

418
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,960
What happens after this line succeeds is
that they cross you over. And since

419
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,060
they're still strafing towards
you, this happens even as you die.

420
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:27,938
The thing is that they don't
change directions when you do,

421
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:29,730
they change
directions after they've

422
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,710
crossed you over after the line works
after they've gotten further to the side

423
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,490
than you did, which got you in front of
them, regardless of whether you were

424
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,711
trying to stab them or not.
That is the meaning of this line.

425
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,677
The fact that you were
going in only one direction

426
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:47,520
doesn't mean that
they're not going to change

427
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,030
their own. And that's because the
direction in which he's strafing only

428
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,361
depends on where you
are in relation to him.

429
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,756
Now, obviously, knowing this is going

430
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:02,220
to help us to recover and to know when to
change directions, like here we're both

431
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,354
strafing in the same way and
eventually he crosses me over.

432
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:09,393
And at that point, I know that I have
to change directions in order to get him.

433
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:12,840
So that's good and all
but how can we really,

434
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:17,509
take advantage of people crossing
us over like this? Let's have a look.

435
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:22,805
This guy here is going to be coming after
me like so. And I don't go for the stab

436
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,470
immediately. I just keep on sort of
walking. And at this distance. If I tried

437
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,730
to stab him like this, he's definitely
going to get behind me. And that's because

438
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,750
he's definitely going to get further to
the left than I will kind of like here.

439
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:38,298
But wait.

440
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:43,980
Why don't I just let him get
there instead of fighting it. I mean, at

441
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,960
this range, it's hopeless anyways, so I
can change directions. And now the tables

442
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,580
have turned he tried so hard to strafe
to the left to get me in front of him. But

443
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,350
by moving there, he opened up all of the
space from the right, so by letting him

444
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:04,763
cross me over from one side, I am able to
go for the stab from the other.

445
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:09,762
Now changing directions like this and
letting the other person cross you over,

446
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:12,855
to go for a stab is something
I like to call leading.

447
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:17,607
And although we already discussed changing
directions while going for the stab,

448
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:21,822
leading is something that solves a lot
of your problems while circle strafing.

449
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:25,003
The main one being
running out of space.

450
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:29,010
Just like in here in this tight
hallway, I strafe to the left and once

451
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,780
he sees me doing this, he will also
strafe to the left, only he will attempt to

452
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:39,120
strafe further than I did. So I only
strafe a little bit to the left, not all

453
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,770
the way up to the left wall. And while he
strafes over there, he's going to get all

454
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,880
the way up to that wall. Which is going to
give me all the space from the right the

455
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,245
maximum space that this
hallway has to offer me,

456
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:54,330
in order to go for my
circle strafe safely.

457
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,660
So when you get yourself into a tight spot
by knowing all of this and using this to

458
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,712
your advantage,
you can lead people,

459
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:07,191
into giving you the space which
you initially didn't have for the stab.

460
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:10,416
Let's have a look at some
other examples. The scout

461
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,400
right here is going to be all the way up
to the right side of this hallway. And I'm

462
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,221
already strafing to the left, which is
the optimal situation for the stab.

463
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:22,410
But this pyro is on the middle of this
hallway. If I keep strafing to the left,

464
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:27,240
the stab is definitely not going to work.
So I strafe to the right, and he's all the

465
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,384
way up to the left now, and I,

466
00:30:29,984 --> 00:30:33,159
am in a pretty good position
for a tight stab right now.

467
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:37,154
Also, a great way of getting
people while they're backing off,

468
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,473
is by leading.

469
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:43,140
By leaving people you slowly make
it so that they run out of space, and you

470
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,280
can get close enough to the point where
whether they'd strafe straight backwards

471
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,620
or sideways isn't going to matter. They
would also not have a lot of space to

472
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,420
strafe sideways in tight hallways, which
are great places for you to try leading.

473
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,970
You can abuse the lack of space for your
stab to begin with. Leading solves so many

474
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,710
of your problems while circle strafing.
And it is without a doubt the single most

475
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,400
important thing that you can teach to
yourself in order to get this stab

476
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,260
consistently, not knowing where to strafe
to delays your stab, I think you'll find

477
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,460
that the best circle strafes you'll get
will happen because you knew exactly what

478
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,460
to do at exactly the right moment through
leading. And speaking of the best stabs.

479
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,020
Through circle strafing, you have the
potential to avoid flames. And by knowing

480
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,330
when the pyro is going to start flaming
and leading correctly,

481
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:36,853
you can make this
all the more easier.

482
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:40,827
For example, here I'm jumping
down there's a pyro spotting me.

483
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,950
I know he's going to strafe to the right
to get me in front of him. And from the

484
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,090
distance I have from him, I can roughly
assume when he's going to start flaming,

485
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,440
so I changed strafing directions. And when
I get this close, when I'm beyond the edge

486
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,233
of the flames, and we're
both strafing the same way,

487
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:58,358
then I know that I'm going to
be able to avoid most of them.

488
00:31:58,726 --> 00:32:02,293
Now you also have the potential
to avoid airblast while circle strafing.

489
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,992
Here, as I change directions,
I make him miss the blast.

490
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,093
But avoiding flames and air blasts is
not something you can get consistently.

491
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,819
One time I'll go for it and it
won't work the other time it will.

492
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,353
It's about positioning
yourself in the right spot.

493
00:32:17,412 --> 00:32:19,459
And it's not about
changing directions.

494
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:22,800
Here as I'm circle strafing
this guy I know that,

495
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,524
by strafing in the
same direction,

496
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:28,119
that's what will cause him to
change his direction of strafing.

497
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:30,976
And that's how he
will turn and miss.

498
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,790
You can't really make a pyro
miss his airblast by strafing left and

499
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:39,015
right randomly, you have
to know what you're doing.

500
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:42,596
Okay, so now speaking
of special stabs.

501
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:47,670
You can pull circle strafes from
beneath and from above as long as you

502
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,480
remember the principles. Remember that
you're not jumping at the guy, you're

503
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,680
jumping sideways and you're still waiting
for him to run into you. Same thing with

504
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,630
understands, so it works in the same way.
By knowing how to do this you can stab

505
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,770
people who won't fall for ground level
stabs that easy. For example, this pyro

506
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,610
keeps air blasting by jumping while
pulling the circle strafe I get him to

507
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:13,440
miss the blast. Also by learning how to
air strafe you can get some really fancy

508
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,941
circle strafes,
like really fancy.

509
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,536
But putting all that
aside, there is more to

510
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,780
all of this, not just the way to get fancy
stabs. When you jump straight at people,

511
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:28,890
you expect them to keep walking into you
so it's like you're going for a matador.

512
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,820
But by going for a circle straight from
above. Rather than just going for a stair

513
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,750
stab. It's like the difference between
going for a matador and going for a circle

514
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,860
strafe when you go for a matador or
stair stab people back off. But if you

515
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,613
manage to keep going, you can extend it
into a circle strafe and a backpedal stab.

516
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:51,030
And that's why even if people are
very, very close, you don't jump straight

517
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:56,850
at them, you expect them to back off, you
take a longer jump to compensate for them

518
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:01,590
backing off. Again here, I don't jump
straight at him. I try to find a way to

519
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:07,710
get as further back as I possibly can and
work my way from there. But there is even

520
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:12,870
more to it. Specifically, the overhead
angle solves a big problem for us while

521
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:17,730
we're circle strafing. It can help us to
fight a person's strafe. Optimally, you

522
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,256
would have wanted to let him get there and
to lead him for a stab from the other side.

523
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:28,920
But let's say you could go over him
and ignore this limitation of bumping into

524
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,480
him like this. That's exactly what you can
do. When you jump while your circle

525
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,950
strafing. For example, this pyro let's
say I wouldn't have jumped there. He got

526
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,820
completely behind me. There would have
been nothing that I could do at that

527
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,790
point. But since I'm over him, he's not
blocking me from getting to his back. Same

528
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,259
thing here with this spy we're
both strafing towards the wall.

529
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:53,966
And we'd pretty much
get there at the same time.

530
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:57,913
By jumping over him I
guarantee my stab on him.

531
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:03,140
This is the real potential that you have
with the overhead angle in circle strafing.

532
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:08,169
All right, well, moving on.

533
00:35:09,183 --> 00:35:11,515
Whoa, okay, that
guy's backing off.

534
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,197
Well look at him, I can't matador
him I can't even get close to him.

535
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:18,510
That is until I, do that.

536
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,790
This is a concept about strafing towards
that when I first started using the stab I

537
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:29,010
didn't fully understand. Look at this guy.
He's strafing backwards. He's jumping,

538
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,720
doing everything he can to not get
stabbed, but he does.

539
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:35,063
The moment I
start circle strafing.

540
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,810
People who are strafing towards
are forced into strafing into you just

541
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,010
to be able to get away from you just to be
able to see you. When you just look at it

542
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:49,037
simply it's easy to understand that
strafing itself is avoiding.

543
00:35:49,423 --> 00:35:51,538
Now, okay, that's
not something new.

544
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:54,180
We already talked about
that. You run into them to

545
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,097
make them run into you. But there
was something about it that we missed.

546
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,390
Let me explain for a
second, let's look at this pyro.

547
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:04,450
He's just gonna run at
me and get circle strafed.

548
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:08,730
Okay, now the next time
he sees me, he's a lot more careful. He's

549
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,383
keeping himself steady.
He's backing up, but,

550
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:14,336
the result is exactly the same.

551
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:19,740
The thing is that even when he was
just running at me, because while circle

552
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:25,080
strafing, I strafed to the space behind
him, the adjustments subconsciously pull

553
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,330
him backwards with me. And that's what I
was talking about when I said that every

554
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:35,310
circle strafe eventually gravitates
backwards, the adjustments automatically

555
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:40,500
push you into in front of wherever you're
aiming, whether you're hitting the S key

556
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,630
or not. Whether you're just running at
people or not, since this spy's strafing

557
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,440
to the space behind you, the adjustments
are going to pull you to the space behind

558
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,040
you. And if you're backing up consciously,
that's where you're going to end up

559
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,200
anyways. That's why every good circle
strafe at least at the last moment,

560
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,550
you'll see that the guy you're stabbing is
getting pulled backwards. That's why

561
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,530
stabs like these are not very good. A
person's strafe for is supposed to pull

562
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,490
him backwards. And if it doesn't, then
it's pointless. Strafing towards is

563
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:16,410
supposed to set all players on a very high
level to begin with. Even if a guy is not

564
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,700
thinking it he's going to gain some
distance from whatever he's aiming at, in

565
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,740
the exact same way that a weary player
would get distance from it. Now that means

566
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,570
that a very unaware player could get away
with a lot of stuff. But it also means

567
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,640
that a very weary player would fall for the
same stuff. And that's the power behind

568
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,600
the circle strafe stab to
cover everyone, good or bad.

569
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:46,718
Now, it's very hard to get a stab on
a person who's consciously backing up.

570
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:48,630
But it's equally hard to get a

571
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,860
person who's just running at you because
of all of this. This is why the stab is

572
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,720
very difficult. Even if a person is just
running at you. It feels he has no idea

573
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,370
what he's doing. When he adjusts at you.
He's still hitting the strafe key so he

574
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:07,920
will move back. That's why whenever you're
going for the stab optimally, you always

575
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,270
always want to go for it like he's going
to strafe backwards. You always want to

576
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:18,000
get real close by leading or with anything
else. Now because every circle strafe

577
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,560
eventually gravitates backwards, every
circle strafe has the potential to turn

578
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,050
into a backpedal stab. It happens when the
stab fails, and he doesn't cross you over

579
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,220
completely, meaning you're on the edge
between getting a stab and not getting it.

580
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,590
You're just stuck on each other, fighting
to see who gets further back. Now this

581
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,490
happens if you misclicked or if the
adjustments fucked you up. And it can

582
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:46,260
happen from every angle, including
strafing forwards and strafing backwards.

583
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:50,153
Which is why make the distinction between
strafing backwards and backpedaling.

584
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,459
Now, usually in the backpedal stab.

585
00:38:54,725 --> 00:38:57,870
What you'll see if
you're hitting S, is him on

586
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:01,830
the edge of your view like this. And this
is what you'll see too if he's holding S

587
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,780
and that's beside
the adjustments.

588
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:08,190
You don't really need to see someone in
order to backpedal stab him, you're

589
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:11,448
pushing both the strafe key and the S key
into him,

590
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:14,261
and you can feel
him on your side.

591
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:18,480
Now even though you usually don't
need to look. That's not an excuse not to

592
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,830
do it. Sometimes your stab will miss
specifically because you didn't look he

593
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:28,675
don't just backpedal blindly, I had to
look at him here for it to really work.

594
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,120
Now one thing that can always look weird
in backpedal stabs and even strafing

595
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,190
backward stabs is that sometimes people
just seem to not turn and give you the

596
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,020
stab. As for the people who turn less,
it's just a matter of having lower

597
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,640
sensitivity or they're just expecting you
to stay in front of them. Because when

598
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,900
they started to back up you're in front of
them. They expect you to stay in front of

599
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,210
them, even if you move with them. It just
makes sense. It makes sense

600
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,680
psychologically to you see the spy you
Don't chase him immediately he goes up the

601
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,620
stairs you don't follow him. You back off
and then this happens, but the psychology

602
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,820
or what they think is hardly the reason
it's a matter of out strafing them, even

603
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,873
if they're turning because they're
adjusting, they have to turn back.

604
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:17,633
Okay.

605
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,470
So this next section is going to be about
backpedaling and how it relates to

606
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:27,630
strafing. As you know, in some situations,
even strafing sideways can be someone's

607
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,610
means of getting away from you. But right
now, I want to talk about backpedaling and

608
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,330
not the backpedaling that results as an
extension to circle strafing,

609
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:41,130
backpedaling, as we usually think about it
would be the guy holding down the S key

610
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,470
while looking at you. Now this happens
sometimes when the guy is surprised or

611
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:52,170
loses you. So he moves back in this kind
of quarter of a circle backwards movement.

612
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:56,910
Now this is not a normal way of backing
away from people. This is the panic way of

613
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,620
backing away. You're not supposed to get
this consistently on anyone but I just

614
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:07,110
want you to understand for now this motion
of a quarter of a circle backwards. Okay,

615
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:11,700
now this is how it relates to strafing
when your circle strafe extends into a

616
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,190
backpedal stab on someone you disrupt his
strafe and you surprise him. So he gets

617
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,042
to back away from you abnormally, using
this quarter of a circle.

618
00:41:21,383 --> 00:41:24,459
He gets to detach from
your backpedal stab.

619
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:29,660
Now, after they're done backpedaling,
they're going to be strafing again.

620
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,760
Getting the stab after
that point is really unlikely

621
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,960
because they get far away from you. But
these stabs can represent well how they

622
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,110
start strafing towards at you again after
they're done backpedaling. So I just want

623
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:48,900
you to understand how this works. The guy
loses you or gets into a backpedal stab and

624
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,370
does the quarter of a circle by
backpedaling and then he strafes towards

625
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:58,590
you again, usually strafing backwards. And
that's how he gets you back on his sights

626
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,970
again. So let's take a look at it one more
time. He's going to strafe towards me

627
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,310
backpedal, quarter of a circle and then
strafe towards me again. Now those

628
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:13,170
things chain each other. A circle strafe
can turn into a backpedal, which can turn

629
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:17,520
into a circle strafe again. And it's
extremely apparent, especially when

630
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,470
they're using melee at you. And especially
if they're pulling it out as they backup.

631
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,670
It's funny people who have better strafes
will pull out their melee and be able to

632
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,630
strafe into you immediately while other
people will detach from you and they'll

633
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,362
lose you for a second but it will actually
make them harder to stab.

634
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:38,671
Okay, enough about
strafing and backpedaling.

635
00:42:38,884 --> 00:42:41,705
What about people who
only backpedal? I mean,

636
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,540
that's possible, right, you wouldn't
really get the chance to try to circle

637
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,380
strafe them. If they're not strafing at
you to begin with. They're only moving

638
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,510
back and forth and not sideways. And
usually you can't really get people while

639
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,620
they're doing the quarter of a circle
thing, while backpedaling, but as we know

640
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,970
the quarter of a circle is actually just
holding down the S key and aiming with the

641
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,560
mouse. Meaning that you can bait them to
back off from one direction to stab them

642
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:13,080
from the other. It pretty much means that
you can matador them, so yeah, people

643
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,430
who are only using the W and S key while
running it you. You can just pretty much

644
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,510
matador them as long as it's shallow
enough you can get them as or before

645
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,170
they're backing off just by playing it
out. For example here against this

646
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:30,330
soldier, I go right and left and he backs
up at the last moment but it was too late

647
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,170
for him. Now of course, it's optimal to
get the matador like this, but it

648
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:39,240
can extend into an actual backpedal stab.
And this is the easiest one to perform

649
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,540
because you're already used to matadors.
So you know, we can get a backpedal stab,

650
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,640
on a person who's backpedaling by
extending a matador. And we can get a

651
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,700
backpedal stab by leading on a person
who's strafing backwards. So what's the

652
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,450
difference? Why do we even care about
this? Well, the thing is, you need to know

653
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,050
how to approach a person you need to know
whether he's going to strafe sideways,

654
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,950
and whether he's going to just straight up
back away from you. You need to know how

655
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,150
to start the stab differently. Because
this is just one specific point where the

656
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,950
stabs happen to collide. Surprise matador
can work on a guy who's backing off

657
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:22,980
but not a guy who's strafing. So for the
people who are just using W and S, I know

658
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,020
that I can just catch him
by while he's running at me.

659
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:28,875
I'm just going to have to
tie my matador in nicely.

660
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:31,920
Or maybe I can catch him with
a matador just as he's backing

661
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,870
off. And I need to know that this right
and left movement of mine can extend into

662
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,700
a backpedal stab, I got to think ahead
before I even meet him. I got to know that

663
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,880
he's going to back off I need to know that
potentially there's going to be a quarter

664
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,648
of a circle. I need to know all of this
before I go for the stab.

665
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:55,174
Now, backpedaling in itself is not a
worse form of movement than strafing.

666
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:58,104
It's just that spies are
more used to matadors.

667
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:00,450
So they're more likely
to go for matadors,

668
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,080
which means that people who are backing
off are more vulnerable to them. And that

669
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,340
could be bad sometimes. Look at this guy,
he's strafing I couldn't matador him but

670
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,600
he's stopping himself. Every few seconds
he just stops and he backs off because

671
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,640
he's afraid, which gets him stabbed in the
end. Had he just kept running at me while

672
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,540
strafing it would have not happened to
him. Now, as for people who are standing

673
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,190
still, your matador on them could also
extend into a backpedal stab, I find that

674
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,030
a lot of newer players are doing this.
When a good player does this and gets

675
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:34,350
stabbed, it just looks silly. In the end,
them standing could buy you time to get

676
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,517
closer to them, or it could give them time
to react to you perfectly.

677
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:41,516
Now going back a little,

678
00:45:41,974 --> 00:45:44,660
to how strafing can
combine with backpedaling.

679
00:45:45,401 --> 00:45:48,193
Some people are able to
backpedal away from you.

680
00:45:48,554 --> 00:45:51,840
Even before they collided
with you by just taking a step

681
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,240
forward, they're able to backpedal and
reset the angle for your stab. They're

682
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,664
capable of turning the strafe.
These people have shorter strafes,

683
00:46:01,957 --> 00:46:03,510
when they're strafing towards.

684
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:07,920
See this, he's supposed to keep
strafing sideways into me.

685
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,604
But after just a couple
of steps sideways,

686
00:46:10,628 --> 00:46:13,260
he takes a step forwards,
which allows him to

687
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:19,230
take a step backwards and keep strafing at
me but in a different angle. Now he backs

688
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:23,430
off before he touches me, because he
allowed himself to take another step

689
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:29,730
forwards, he can reset the stab and turn
it 90 degrees. Now after this happens, you

690
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:34,910
can sort of get this stab. But let's just
say that it's not happening.

691
00:46:35,277 --> 00:46:39,590
See this guy, I start circle
strafing him, and he turns it.

692
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:42,750
So the next time
I see him, I let him

693
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,816
get behind me to get into
a backpedal stab with him.

694
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:50,070
You see people are only
capable of turning the strafe,

695
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:52,980
when you strafe to
their side, if you're still in

696
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,290
front of them, then there's also no point
in turning. So if you go for a shallower

697
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,540
strafe, they're not as capable of turning
it around. Now basically, this means that

698
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,920
you want to go for the strafing backward
stabs a lot more than even those are going

699
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,240
to have to have some kind of edge to them.
Remember that people are still gravitating

700
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,070
towards you just differently from the way
you initially want them to. But in the

701
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,870
end, going for even a very fancy strafing
backward stab really much means that

702
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,911
you're going for a
normal circle strafe.

703
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:28,213
And if you go for those, they're
eventually going to turn around on you.

704
00:47:28,644 --> 00:47:32,040
So we have to find a
way in which we can get

705
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,919
them consistently
while they turn the strafe.

706
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,700
But we got to understand
some things first.

707
00:47:38,185 --> 00:47:41,940
Now, the biggest problem
with people who are turning the strafe,

708
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,710
is that when you go for a circle strafe
normally, no matter how, you plan for the

709
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:51,720
stab to end across the wall, so that you
don't walk into the wall, you're always

710
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,100
going to do it. But when the guy is
turning the strafe, since he turns it in

711
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,960
a way that you're not expecting. And since
he turns it 90 degrees, he's always going

712
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,510
to end up at the wall. And as we remember
getting a stab off the wall is kind of

713
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,640
unlikely. So because of your initial
instinct, while circle strafing, which is

714
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,290
hard enough on its own, you're going to
get baited into a stab, and you're not

715
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,100
going to get it. By the way, if they're
stuck against the wall, although you're

716
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,360
not stabbing them, it means that they're
not getting any further away from you.

717
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:29,370
So there is some potential to this, here's
what you do, when he's turning the stab

718
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:34,020
and strafing across the wall. Don't fight
to try to get behind him, because that's

719
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:39,630
unlikely let him get to the wall before
you do. Now, usually, it will lead to

720
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:44,280
something like this. But if you're
planning it out, when he's at your side,

721
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,966
you can fight him for the backpedal stab
very easily, actually.

722
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,090
Let's go over this
one more time.

723
00:48:51,426 --> 00:48:54,510
When he's at that situation
where he's going to strafe across the

724
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:58,980
wall. Instead of strafing into you. You
strafe it to him, you let him get to your

725
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,870
side. And from there, the adjustments
force him to look back into you. You

726
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:09,660
basically trap him on the wall for a split
second backpedal stab. Now be careful,

727
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,340
don't let them get too far up to your
side. If there's too much distance, it

728
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,600
could end up like that. So yeah, I just
want you to understand this split

729
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,380
second backpedal stab. You don't even
need an exact wall to do it. Just

730
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,460
something that would keep them near you.
Although a straight wall would be better

731
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,750
because it guides you and it traps them
and preventing them from getting stuck.

732
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,530
It's all okay as long as you remember the
principles, they're not strafing directly

733
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:40,161
into you. So you have to strafe into
him. And then you force him into a stab.

734
00:49:40,756 --> 00:49:43,351
Now, people who are
capable of doing this,

735
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:45,810
aren't capable of
doing it all the time.

736
00:49:46,052 --> 00:49:48,538
Could have gotten the normal
circle strafe on him there.

737
00:49:48,672 --> 00:49:51,450
The angle has to be
right for them to turn it.

738
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:55,590
But neither of you can
really predict what the angle will be in

739
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:59,970
real time play, so you know that there's a
wall you want to exaggerate and give them

740
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,160
the space to turn it on purpose. So that
you could trap them on the wall later.

741
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:09,900
That way you play it safe by exhausting
their best strafe. Here, I do the exact

742
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,190
same thing only in reverse. I give him
space because I know he's going to turn and

743
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,691
get to the wall where I could stab him.

744
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:22,586
But you know what, in actuality, just
getting the normal circle strafe stab,

745
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,980
is already hard
enough as it is. So if you

746
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,390
see the opportunity to let him get to your
side and get that easy split second

747
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:35,070
backpedal stab, while he's strafing across
the wall, do it, whether he's turning the

748
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:40,830
strafe or not, it's easier this way. That
stab was exactly like this one. Only with

749
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:46,050
this guy, I didn't anticipate it. I mean,
usually you will not see it coming since

750
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,360
it happens so suddenly. But if you get to
look ahead and see that this angle might

751
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,400
happen, then it's an easier solution for
you to get the stab. Rather than taking a

752
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,090
wider circle. You go for the stab from the
inside. You let him get to your side while

753
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,410
circle strafing. And you get to do the
split second backpedal stab, that's way

754
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:12,090
easier. Some people and especially people
who are turning the strafe are way more

755
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:17,130
vulnerable to you going for the stab from
the inside like this. Eventually you learn

756
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,951
the distance from which you can try to
force them into the wall like this.

757
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,095
And afterwards do it
on the outside as well.

758
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:27,988
But damn all this
backpedaling everywhere.

759
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:31,748
It's not easy to deal with,
backpedal stabs are hard.

760
00:51:32,062 --> 00:51:34,946
Usually we'd would want to
stab people who are chasing us.

761
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:38,400
Not running away from us, wish
there were some easier way to

762
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,480
know where they're going and easier way to
stab them, without them being able to

763
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,360
detach from you or pull any sort of weird
strafes. Well, you'd be happy to know that

764
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,783
there actually is. So
let's talk about corners.

765
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:56,342
For starters, did you know that if
you try to round the corner entirely,

766
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:58,210
while a person is
backing up into it.

767
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:00,682
He's going to get further
back faster than you.

768
00:52:00,835 --> 00:52:02,583
And that's because
you have more space to

769
00:52:02,608 --> 00:52:07,530
cover to get to the same place than he
does. That's why usually when people

770
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:12,960
detach from you, you can't stab them after
that it goes like this. But actually this

771
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,790
means that if you take the inside of a
turn, while he's rounding it to back up,

772
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,784
you're going to be getting
further faster than he does.

773
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,240
So whenever you catch somebody
who's about to back up into a corner,

774
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:27,600
like this demoman, he's about to

775
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,299
back up to the right over there, you can
just take the inside of that corner,

776
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,983
to get further
back than he does.

777
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:37,896
Now, people do this all the
time as they fight and shoot

778
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,030
they like peeking through corners to use
them as cover and they're preparing to

779
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:46,080
back up into the corner in case something
comes their way. Of course, it doesn't

780
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,830
really matter how they backup into the
corner, whether they're backing off or

781
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,235
strafing, you're still
going to stab them.

782
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:56,040
Now you can get creative with
it. If there's something to jump on.

783
00:52:56,342 --> 00:52:59,460
To cut the corner even
tighter, you can do it. People

784
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,970
always have a plan of escape. And the more
you do this, the more you will realize

785
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:07,350
that you can make this stab happen
anywhere, the best players, you'll find

786
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,550
will eventually back up to someplace. And
if you could just take that corner tighter

787
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:15,840
than they do, you can get there faster
than they do. And get them just like that.

788
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,580
Now, of course, this is just some mechanic
that helps you stab people, it's not an

789
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,630
absolute thing. You can take you to a
corner and tighter than he does, and he

790
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:28,710
will still get behind you. Just like how
you can sometimes take the outside of a

791
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:33,240
corner. And he's more likely to get behind
you. But you'll still get him kinda like

792
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,272
how sometimes you can stab
people who detach from you too.

793
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:38,867
Now we kind of know
this stab already. Right?

794
00:53:39,265 --> 00:53:41,766
The stab that uses this
mechanic, it's c2c.

795
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,715
But typically with c2c,

796
00:53:43,942 --> 00:53:47,520
you go behind the corner to trick
people into backing up so that you

797
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,690
could get a backpedal stab on them. But
this time the guy was already backing up.

798
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,913
And all you did is find
a way to outstrafe him.

799
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:58,866
Just purely no tricks, get
there faster than he does.

800
00:54:00,185 --> 00:54:03,300
Also, with your movements,
you can really manipulate

801
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:07,345
what way they'll back off to and which
corner they will choose to back off to.

802
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:09,499
For example here
I let him pass me,

803
00:54:09,523 --> 00:54:12,810
and I bait him into going
into the corner behind me.

804
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,415
And another nice little perk to this
is that people who are standing still,

805
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:21,319
it's a little easier to understand
where they'll back off to next.

806
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:25,581
Now there's a
little add on here,

807
00:54:25,851 --> 00:54:30,275
I want to talk to you about complexes
of corners, double corners and

808
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,550
corner systems. A corner system is when
the road turns in one direction and then

809
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:40,350
shortly after turns the other. This is the
path I have to take in order to move

810
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,790
across a place like this. If I'd want to
stab anyone in this first turn, if I

811
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:48,785
don't stab him immediately you'll be able
to take that other turn away from me.

812
00:54:49,063 --> 00:54:53,562
And it'll be like he's detaching from
me, which is something we don't want.

813
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,038
You have to be aware of these
kinds of unfavorable environments.

814
00:54:58,158 --> 00:54:59,620
They can mess
you up pretty often.

815
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:04,132
There's a corner system here to the right,
and then to the left where I stab him.

816
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:07,890
But had I not stabbed him right
there, I'd have to take into account that

817
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:11,850
after this left turn, there's another
right turn, you have to be aware or it's

818
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,900
gonna mess you up. Now on the other side
of these corner complexes, we have a

819
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,270
double corner. This is a 180 degrees turn,
it's twice the corner, hence double

820
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:25,860
corner. Now the backpedaling player has to
cover twice the distance, which was

821
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,880
already way longer than yours.
Essentially, you can get way further back

822
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,650
than he does very easily. Here I recover
from this corner system with a double

823
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:39,750
corner. Strafe-wise this is an extremely
favorable situation. Let's take a look at

824
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:45,000
this spy he's very hard to stab. But let's
take a look at this. It's twice the turn,

825
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:48,284
it's a double corner. And it's
going to give me the advantage.

826
00:55:50,878 --> 00:55:54,012
Of course, none of this actually
has to happen in a corner.

827
00:55:54,246 --> 00:55:55,786
It can just be by the road.

828
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,168
Only two options here,

829
00:55:57,193 --> 00:56:02,160
this stairway or this road leading
into it. Together they create a

830
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,900
turn, they create a corner for you but not
an actual corner, it's a turn in which you

831
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,997
can try to take the inside of, to try
for the stab. And this turn right here,

832
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:17,940
it's also pretty much a corner, I can still
take the inside of this road to try to

833
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,740
stab him. And this entire game is built
this way. In the end of every hall

834
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,730
there's a turn, there's always somewhere
to go. For example, here I couldn't get

835
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,345
behind the spy by a new to the turn was
coming up.

836
00:56:29,698 --> 00:56:31,418
And that I could
use it for myself.

837
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:36,750
People play according to these roads. Look
at this soldier, he could have just kept

838
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:42,510
backing up but the chose to go down the
stairs. It's somewhat up to them to decide

839
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,850
what is a corner what is a safe place to
back off into. And that's beside your

840
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:52,636
typical corners, it doesn't really have to
be even a defined turn.

841
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,716
For example, here, I just assume
that he's going to back up to the window.

842
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:59,293
So I know how he's
going to turn over there.

843
00:56:59,808 --> 00:57:02,970
Now here we have this
very defined turn for him,

844
00:57:03,093 --> 00:57:04,570
to go up the stairs.

845
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:09,962
Let's look at this. It's not an actual
turn here at the bottom of the stairs.

846
00:57:09,987 --> 00:57:13,280
But the scout decided to
back up that way anyways.

847
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,804
So again, it's up
for them to decide,

848
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:20,010
what's a safe place to back
up into and what's not. But of course,

849
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:24,330
typically you just want a nice clean
corner to not give them the space to

850
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:29,310
backup anywhere else. When you get a clean
corner. There are no questions asked.

851
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,194
So okay...

852
00:57:33,327 --> 00:57:36,846
You can be original with it, it doesn't
have to be a clean corner. It could even

853
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:41,550
be like these corner stairs, just take
the inside and get up there faster than

854
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:45,420
they do. It's always weird when you get
backpedal stabbed. It's not something you

855
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,320
can understand by watching this footage,
it really feels like you should be getting

856
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,233
away from him but you're not.

857
00:57:52,426 --> 00:57:56,716
Getting back to the corners. Another
reason this stab works well is because,

858
00:57:57,226 --> 00:57:59,980
when people back off, they
have to see the corner.

859
00:58:00,716 --> 00:58:03,940
You can't take a corner as
tightly when you're backing off.

860
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:08,120
When you're facing the corner you can
see it and then you can accurately just,

861
00:58:08,593 --> 00:58:12,090
glue yourself to the inner wall. But
when you're backing up, it's different.

862
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:15,250
When you're backing up,
you have to see the corner,

863
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,125
or at least feel that you
passed it completely,

864
00:58:18,365 --> 00:58:20,132
in order to backup into it.

865
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:23,526
Now it doesn't matter how good
you are at rounding corners when

866
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:28,200
you're backing off. Eventually you will
get glued to the outer walls, which will

867
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,400
help you get stabbed this way. Let's take
a look at this scout. We're going to have

868
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,050
like four people chasing him and why did
he take the corner so wide to get away?

869
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:42,681
Well unfortunately for him, this is just
the way it naturally works.

870
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,243
Okay. Alright.

871
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,843
Well, that was a mouthful.

872
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:54,076
We've covered a lot of things in this
video, some practical some theoretical.

873
00:58:54,513 --> 00:58:57,420
Usually I'd be summarizing
things here but I will

874
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,610
not because this is not over. A circle
strafe is a stab done on a person who is

875
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:06,138
strafing and there are other forms of
strafing in this game.

876
00:59:06,664 --> 00:59:09,244
You've probably noticed
for yourself in this video.

877
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,297
People could have
moved differently.

878
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,709
Simply put, nothing has ended.

879
00:59:14,282 --> 00:59:16,973
So I want you to take everything
you've learned here so far.

880
00:59:17,317 --> 00:59:21,017
I want you to put it in a teeny tiny
box called strafing towards.

881
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:24,020
And I want you to click
the next video.

882
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,560
See you then.
