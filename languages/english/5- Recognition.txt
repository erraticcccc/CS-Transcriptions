1
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,246
Alright, last section.

2
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,270
Let's have a recap, shall we?

3
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,407
First of all we've learnt of level 1.

4
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,480
It's the circlestrafe stab

5
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:34,693
you'd normally think about.

6
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:36,663
You leave people some space

7
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:38,385
and they strafe sideways into you.

8
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,561
But the more circly stabs like this one,

9
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:43,236
they sure look nice, but they're not

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,698
the point of circlestrafing.

11
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,375
Strafing is supposed to be avoiding

12
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:49,095
and the best stabs you'll do

13
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,119
are going to be on people who are avoiding

14
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:53,516
eventually with strafing backwards.

15
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:56,015
You can go for the stab from the outside,

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,377
like we've seen so far.

17
00:00:57,714 --> 00:01:00,462
Or if the guy doesn't seem
as vulnerable to it,

18
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:02,662
you can go for the stab from the inside.

19
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,938
Let them get to your side
just for a second,

20
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:07,741
and go for a split-second backpedal stab.

21
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:09,089
And speaking of those,

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,090
the special people on this level

23
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:12,585
are people who are capable

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,740
of turning the strafe.

25
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:15,722
You have to go for an inside stab

26
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:16,763
against these people,

27
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:18,405
or you have to trap them on the wall

28
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:20,205
for a split-second backpedal stab.

29
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:22,555
But even people who can turn the strafe

30
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:23,824
can't do it forever.

31
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,792
You can take into account the fact

32
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:27,480
that they'll turn, and get them

33
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,815
just a little more normally.

34
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,890
Next is level 2, or as I like to call it,

35
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:34,180
level 0, since it's not actually

36
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,688
about strafing. It's about people

37
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:36,997
who run at you with W,

38
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:38,697
and then back up using the S key.

39
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:40,900
You stab the people on this level

40
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:42,569
with very well-timed matadors

41
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:44,671
which can extend into backpedal stabs.

42
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:47,807
Next, we have level 3.

43
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:49,923
It's about people fighting and strafing

44
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:51,104
between two spots

45
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,986
and it comes in 3 speeds.

46
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:55,647
The normal speed allows you
to go for the free spot

47
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:57,503
between the spots they're strafing in.

48
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,260
The faster strafes force you
to run straight at them

49
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:01,841
to the spot where they're in,

50
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,208
from the same distance.

51
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:05,178
And special people on this level

52
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:06,251
are going to be juking.

53
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,296
You can stab people who are juking

54
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,868
by exploiting their support
of how they juke,

55
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:13,466
or universally by gluing to them.

56
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,582
Level 3 is a level that combines

57
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,606
with any of the other levels of strafing,

58
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:18,811
which means that when they're

59
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,493
not strafing around, when they're backing

60
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:22,682
away from you, or when they're chasing you,

61
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:24,537
they'll be using the other level.

62
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:26,265
Which could be the next level

63
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,780
of strafing: level 4.

64
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:30,737
People on level 4 are players

65
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,761
who take the outer side of turns

66
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,153
and attack you from the side.

67
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:36,289
You stab these people by going

68
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:37,597
forwards and backwards.

69
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,799
Although at some points
the strafe gets turned,

70
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:41,841
gets edged out. And so, you can get them

71
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:43,597
with a very specific set

72
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:45,452
of managed matadors.

73
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,207
All you have to do is remember that

74
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,514
all they want to do

75
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,216
is to let you pass and stay safe.

76
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,460
Sometimes they wanna lead you on,

77
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,420
and try to outstrafe you in a corner

78
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:55,748
or something like that. And you can

79
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:57,223
use that to your advantage.

80
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,325
Next up is the first in

81
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,834
 the amazing level series:

82
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,475
level 4.1.

83
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,832
They attack from the side
and then they back off,

84
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:06,446
and when you give them the space

85
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,470
to walk into you, they use that space

86
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:09,582
to outstrafe you,

87
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,384
so a circlestrafe doesn't work.

88
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,506
What you need to do is to stick yourself

89
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,341
to them to not give them any space,

90
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,030
and get the glue stab on them.

91
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,164
Next is the level 4.2.

92
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:20,987
Is the very extreme and intense

93
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,428
version of level 4.

94
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,657
But it still works with the same principles

95
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:26,853
and it's countered with very early,

96
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,878
well timed or very well played out

97
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:30,296
level 4 stabs.

98
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,179
And last but not least,

99
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:34,761
we have the level 4.3.

100
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:36,556
Those are people who take the inner side

101
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,145
of corners in order to stay extra safe,

102
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,901
be extra fast, or to outstrafe you.

103
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:44,123
They're cutting corners,
they're cutting turns,

104
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:46,147
they're jumping on props to block you.

105
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,347
You get this players with the 4.3 stab.

106
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:54,637
Now, for people who are strafing

107
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:57,349
you have to circlestrafe them in some way,

108
00:03:57,752 --> 00:03:59,432
and as long as the guy's strafe

109
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,066
is consistent and good,

110
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:03,590
you're not gonna be able to matador him

111
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,411
even if he's just running at you.

112
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:06,821
That's because his strafe

113
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:08,548
being good saves him.

114
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:11,152
You have to try and circlestrafe them

115
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:12,725
or you're gonna get nothing.

116
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:14,867
But that being said,

117
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:16,576
no form of circlestrafe,

118
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,886
no matter on what level,

119
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:20,006
is going to replace a matador

120
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:22,976
If the guy is just running at you with W,

121
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:24,764
it doesn't matter how you go for it

122
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,801
you can't circlestrafe him in any way,

123
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,421
you have to matador him.

124
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:30,183
In the end, stabbing is about

125
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:31,270
matching your movements

126
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:32,806
to the other player's movement.

127
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,989
Now, I define a circlestrafe stab

128
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,164
as a stab done by strafing,

129
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,189
on a player who is strafing.

130
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,842
And I also said that you cannot matador

131
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,310
a person who is strafing.

132
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:46,085
But there will be times where you'll go

133
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,407
left and right and get a person

134
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:48,855
who was strafing anyways.

135
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:50,997
And it's important to understand

136
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:53,393
why it's not going to be happening again.

137
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,881
You went left, you went right,

138
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,756
and you happen to get him with this

139
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:59,819
circlestrafe-ish stab thing.

140
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,528
Let's take a look.

141
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,391
Just gonna go and get a matador on this guy

142
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:07,273
and here.

143
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:10,143
But this guy is on level 1,

144
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,540
what happens here is
that he turns the strafe

145
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,583
and we both get stuck on the wall.

146
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:16,276
And I just strafed to the left,

147
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,211
and strafing to the right at this point

148
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,673
just happens to be what I have to do

149
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:23,202
in order to circlestrafe him.

150
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:25,825
Now it's true, I went for a matador on him,

151
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,261
but that was correct only for that one,

152
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,297
very specific situation,

153
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,538
and no other situation.

154
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:34,367
Let's have a look at another

155
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:35,814
example here, slightly different.

156
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:38,680
This guy is strafing, we can
see that he's strafing,

157
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:40,806
but I still matadored him.

158
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:43,436
What happened this time
is that he backed up

159
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,460
into me, in that last second.

160
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:49,222
Now this is what actually happened.

161
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:52,531
It was just too small for
us to normally see.

162
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,801
This next one with a soldier

163
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:55,982
is actually really interesting.

164
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:57,577
I strafe over to the left,

165
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:59,272
and he strafes so much

166
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:00,853
that he crosses me over

167
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,895
and now has to strafe to the right

168
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,919
and he happens to strafe forwards.

169
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:08,221
Now these circlestrafe-ish stabs

170
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:10,222
are why spies can still run around

171
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:12,051
nowadays and get matadors,

172
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:13,840
even though most of the players they

173
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:15,275
will encounter will be strafing.

174
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,231
The correct strafe for the circlestrafe

175
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:21,174
just happened to be the second strafe

176
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,969
of the matador that they go for

177
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:24,530
for that one scenario.

178
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,866
Or just a managed matador stab

179
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,308
that they didn't know about.

180
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:30,463
Now, spies with a lot of intuition

181
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:32,338
will get this a lot, but intuition

182
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:33,671
can only get you so far.

183
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:35,628
Also, when I say that

184
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:38,297
a person who's strafing
cannot be matadored,

185
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:41,014
that's only if his strafe is consistent.

186
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,038
Meaning that he strafes all the time

187
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,944
and doesn't just start randomly

188
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,239
running at you with W.

189
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,101
And it's also only true

190
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,216
for people who have good strafes.

191
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:52,693
Now, this can be especially apparent

192
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:54,047
with level 4 strafes.

193
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:56,630
They can sometimes be so shallow,

194
00:06:56,654 --> 00:07:00,113
that I can just matador him
no problem every time.

195
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:02,522
And players with bad movement like this

196
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,736
are also something that

197
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,358
I'm not counting in this tutorial.

198
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:08,301
Now, speaking of shallow
strafes, moving on.

199
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:10,697
This pyro is going to be on level 1.

200
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,498
I go for the stab, I know how he's

201
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:14,522
gonna play it out, and we get him.

202
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:17,183
But you know, it was clutchy.

203
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,665
It was very very clutchy.

204
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:22,463
It was almost not a stab at that point,

205
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,050
which is how it's supposed to be.

206
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,173
Because when you go for a circlestrafe,

207
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,041
you strafe to the space behind them,

208
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,403
their strafe is supposed

209
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:31,751
to pull them backwards.

210
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:33,059
And if they don't have a strafe

211
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:34,381
that saves them like this,

212
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:36,002
then they're probably not really

213
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:37,335
worthwhile players.

214
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,826
So your stabs will always end up looking

215
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,674
like something like this: very clutchy,

216
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,429
almost not stabs.

217
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,491
And you know what? A lot of the times,

218
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:47,193
they really won't be.

219
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,264
So one spy once asked me:

220
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:51,717
how do you make your circles so wide?

221
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:53,106
which the is correct question.

222
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:54,934
Circlestrafing is about making

223
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,869
a wider circle than they're making.

224
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,332
And the spy while stabbing has

225
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,028
a laughably shallow strafe.

226
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:04,183
A spy always look like an idiot

227
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:05,512
when he's trying to stab you.

228
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:08,815
That's because unlike any
other natural strafe,

229
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:11,043
a spy's strafe while stabbing you

230
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,945
does not have any adjustments.

231
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:15,715
You don't adjust when
you're trying to stab,

232
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:17,537
so you don't widen your strafe.

233
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,498
Here I make this really consistent,

234
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:22,842
non-changing circle, and
once he gets to my back,

235
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:26,646
I even snap my view
further into the circle,

236
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,048
making it even smaller, letting him

237
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:31,072
get even further behind me.

238
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,413
This is just how we're brought up.

239
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,548
Snapping your view in
the opposite direction

240
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,330
that you're strafing is something

241
00:08:37,354 --> 00:08:38,891
every spy knows to do.

242
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:42,501
But in reality, it doesn't make any sense.

243
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,777
So when I realized this,

244
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:47,120
a long time ago, I tried to look away

245
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,662
from the player when I was
circlestrafing him.

246
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:52,004
Which was very hard until

247
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,193
this first time, when I got it.

248
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,791
I finally started to learn what it means

249
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,419
to adjust consciously as a spy.

250
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:00,586
Let's have a look at this.

251
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,351
I'm gonna circlestrafe this scout here,

252
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,474
and let's pause right here.

253
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:06,945
It really looks like I'm
gonna get it, right?

254
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,848
But experience tells us

255
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:10,872
that this is not how it's gonna work.

256
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:13,628
So as I go for the circlestrafe,

257
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:16,422
I say "no!", it's not gonna work like that.

258
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:19,012
I turn my view away from him,

259
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,495
thus widening my circle.

260
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,122
Let's take a look at the result here.

261
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:25,752
This is a pretty clean backstab.

262
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:29,089
I mean, he also widened
his circle by adjusting,

263
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:30,918
which would have brought the stab

264
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:32,825
to look a lot like this.

265
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:35,655
But can you see how this angle is better?

266
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:38,051
Making your circles wider means that,

267
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:40,075
what wouldn't have been a stab

268
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,439
is going to be a shoulder stab,

269
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:43,095
what would've been a shoulder stab

270
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:45,284
is going to be a sidestab or a backstab.

271
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,213
It improves your angle.

272
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:50,810
Remember that a spy is only usually

273
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,834
capable of going for a stab like this.

274
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:55,995
You strafe and you just keep on strafing

275
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,437
hoping for it to work.

276
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:58,831
If they get to your side,

277
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,914
you can extend it into a backpedal stab,

278
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:02,938
and although you have
to prepare for that too,

279
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,206
you're supposed to attempt to take it

280
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,339
wider than them at the beginning.

281
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,488
Let's have a look at this example here,

282
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,132
I'm gonna go for a level 1
jumpstab on this guy,

283
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:15,007
and it already looks like he's about

284
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,576
to get to my side, so by adjusting

285
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:20,179
I go around him going around me.

286
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:22,908
You just gotta train yourself to not look

287
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:24,550
at the person while stabbing,

288
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,575
you have to flcik your view or initially

289
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,734
look ahead when you're stabbing.

290
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:30,656
Now I'll continue to stress out

291
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:32,103
how important doing this is,

292
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:34,821
by showing you some spy-on-spy footage.

293
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,957
How close am I here from getting stabbed?

294
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:39,625
Really damn close.

295
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,108
So yeah, usually when you're fighting

296
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:43,583
a spy who's any good,

297
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,032
even if you stab him, he will be

298
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:47,832
very close to stabbing you.

299
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,483
Just how you try to stab a normal person,

300
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:52,258
he's very close to not getting stabbed.

301
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,213
So you know what? I don't want him

302
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,435
anywhere near this side of mine,

303
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,818
because I know what that can lead to.

304
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,399
Alright? I want him on this side.

305
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:01,747
I have to adjust.

306
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,443
So as you're fighting, you have to

307
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,178
teach yourself that it's not ok

308
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:07,300
that he's in front of you,

309
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,121
you gotta flick ahead, and to control

310
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,164
yourself to not flick back too soon.

311
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:13,552
You don't wanna accidentally get stabbed

312
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:16,042
adjusting back, you have to get used to it.

313
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,823
As you're coming at each other,

314
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:20,339
you gotta look ahead, and
make the circle wider

315
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,401
even if you don't think you have to.

316
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,766
You get to a safer angle,

317
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,997
I can't stress that enough.

318
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,137
And this fear of getting
stabbed, in my opinion,

319
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,875
is a great way for you

320
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,844
to practise adjusting yourself.

321
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:33,419
You always have to look ahead.

322
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,127
Let's have a look.

323
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,268
We're both on the stairs here,

324
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,144
I'm gonna try to go around him

325
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:39,919
while he tries to strafe sideways.

326
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:42,395
I'm always looking forwards

327
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:44,023
as much as I can, I'm not turning.

328
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:46,700
Because I know that this
is how he can stab me.

329
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,362
He can't stab me right now
by going around me,

330
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:51,285
this does not lead to collision.

331
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:52,551
And since I know this,

332
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:54,433
it's safe for me to look forwards.

333
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:57,396
Now, this time I'm the one backing off,

334
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,005
and even though he's in front of me,

335
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:01,029
I look ahead as much as possible

336
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:03,161
because that's where we're going,

337
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,891
and I only turn back when
I'm sure it's safe.

338
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:08,594
Then again, if you are adjusting,

339
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,122
and the other guy just has a very

340
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,511
shallow strafe or he's not compensating

341
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:14,165
by taking it widelike you do,

342
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:16,595
then you're just gonna take it too wide

343
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,024
and not be able to stab him.

344
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,121
It might end up working out for you,

345
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,350
but you don't want to be
this far away from them,

346
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:23,816
when you're behind them.

347
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,319
So in order to make sure
none of that happens,

348
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:29,228
all you really gotta do is fight the guy.

349
00:12:29,252 --> 00:12:31,384
Here I see that he gets behind me,

350
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:32,552
has a very wide strafe.

351
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:34,480
So the next time, I know that

352
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,062
I should make mine wider.

353
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:39,198
So it's all about understanding what

354
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,407
the other person is capable of.

355
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:43,022
Same thing here with this soldier.

356
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:45,498
We fight around, I try to get to his side,

357
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,079
and it was very very tight.

358
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:49,715
Only just one more step behind him,

359
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,650
I would've been able to get the stab.

360
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:54,253
So the next time, I adjust
myself just a little bit,

361
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:56,422
and get a pretty clean stab.

362
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:58,397
But you know, up until now,

363
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,421
we've focused on level 1 stabs,

364
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:03,269
making your not-stab into a shoulder stab,

365
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:05,130
your shoulder stab into a sidestab,

366
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:06,178
into a backstab.

367
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,640
Giving you a better angle.

368
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:10,449
But, let's see how it can
help you with level 4.

369
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,191
This scout here lets me pass.

370
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:14,215
But I still go for a matador on him.

371
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,742
And when he gets to my side, by adjusting,

372
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,371
I can actually get the level 4 stab on him.

373
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:21,734
Let me explain how this works.

374
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:23,903
I'm gonna strafe sideways against this guy,

375
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,679
going for a matador, and he's
gonna get behind me,

376
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:29,148
and by looking ahead while still strafing,

377
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:32,785
it will be like I went sideways
and then backwards.

378
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:36,481
When I adjust while still
holding the strafe key,

379
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:39,138
it moves me back, the adjustments

380
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:42,114
pull me backwards, like with all players.

381
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,577
Can you how I ended up a few steps

382
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:46,602
behind myself while doing this?

383
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,461
Also, against spies when you're going

384
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:49,848
sideways and backwards, you really

385
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,872
wanna look, and let the adjustments

386
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,539
do the backwards part for you.

387
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:55,374
You don't wanna let them get to your side.

388
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:58,237
Having this reflex to adjust
can really save you.

389
00:13:58,261 --> 00:13:59,865
You still don't want them to get to

390
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,948
the side of your back with
the level 4 stab as well.

391
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,385
You want them on the other
side of your screen.

392
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,975
So learning to adjust by reflex

393
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,170
can be a great solution for level 4s

394
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:12,071
as a recovery, or when you weren't

395
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:14,313
ready to go backwards with the S key.

396
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:17,383
This reminds me of before I found out

397
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,552
about forwards and backwards and level 4.

398
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,576
I would only get level 4 players

399
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
with really lucky managed matadors,

400
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:26,312
or with a matador which
I had adjusted enough

401
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:29,288
for it to turn into a backwards strafe.

402
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,876
Those were some great times in which

403
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:33,340
I had no idea what I was doing.

404
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:35,365
But nowadays, even if you don't know

405
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,389
exactly what the other player is doing,

406
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:39,718
if you have your finger ready on the S key.

407
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:41,739
you can extend any circlestrafe

408
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:43,068
into a backpedal stab.

409
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,357
Just like adjusting, it's a great way

410
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:46,572
to recover sometimes.

411
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,597
As long as you can collide with the player

412
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,709
you can keep him stuck to your side.

413
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,025
You just need to be ready.

414
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:59,852
But you can't always be
completely ready, can you?

415
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,082
Sometimes you'll fail and

416
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:02,554
they'll get so far behind you,

417
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,176
that you can't extend it or

418
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,956
salvage the backpedal stab anymore.

419
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:07,553
So this is

420
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:11,043
a recovery technique for
when you fail horribly.

421
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:13,352
Let's say, for example, you go

422
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:15,377
for a level 1 stab and you fail.

423
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,222
The guy backed off too much.

424
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:19,444
But that also means that he went sideways

425
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,444
enough to get you in front of him.

426
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:22,795
He crossed you over.

427
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,690
We know that from leading.

428
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,466
So as it turns out,

429
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:28,314
right after you fail a stab,

430
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:30,709
you can go for it again
from the other side.

431
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,134
For how much people try to

432
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:33,325
get you in front of them,

433
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,703
if you stop trying to stay

434
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:36,035
in the same line with them

435
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:37,356
for a backpedal stab,

436
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:40,653
let them cross you over,
and you could go for this.

437
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,230
I like calling this: slalom.

438
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,598
When you're both on the same

439
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:47,219
line for the backpedal stab,

440
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:49,228
you feel him on your side

441
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,683
until one of you gets further.

442
00:15:50,707 --> 00:15:52,707
And assuming he does,

443
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,720
that means he crossed you over

444
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,161
and that he's on your other side.

445
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:58,535
You're not supposed to feel

446
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,598
him on your side anymore,

447
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:01,336
so you learn how it feels

448
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,915
rather than how it seems.

449
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:05,664
Another example with this scout,

450
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,199
I think that I'm about to get it,

451
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:09,061
but he slips past me,

452
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:11,530
I can't feel him on my right side anymore

453
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
but I could feel him on the left.

454
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:16,275
So in short,

455
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:18,557
you do a little twirl, your stab failed

456
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:19,872
from one side, but

457
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,887
you can get it from the other.

458
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,476
It's a way to recover from your failed stab

459
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,412
immediately, instead of running

460
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:28,113
away and going for something else.

461
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,229
For example here, I'm gonna

462
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:32,631
run into this pyro and he's

463
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,352
gonna get behind me by surprise,

464
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,469
and at this point, I could
have gone for a stab,

465
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:39,532
but no, I had to turn around

466
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:42,227
go for a very slow, wrong stab

467
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,916
giving him time to react,

468
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,978
while I could have actually just

469
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,386
stabbed him immediately.

470
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,629
See, once he gets behind
you from one side,

471
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:52,177
you can go for it from the other.

472
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,273
No matter how complicated it gets

473
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:56,715
as long as you know which
side it starts from,

474
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,891
then you know where he'll be next.

475
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,746
It's just how it works.

476
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,456
So who can we use this stab against?

477
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,639
Obviously on people who
are strafing towards,

478
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:10,549
and also against people
who are backing off,

479
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,097
because of the direction they're

480
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,986
backing off to from this angle.

481
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:16,103
It works on level 3 because

482
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,127
from this distance, level 3 is

483
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:20,165
exactly like level 1.

484
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,727
And you'd be surprised that

485
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:23,215
it also works on level 4,

486
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,678
and that's because after level 4 succeeds,

487
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:27,846
it chains itself with level 1.

488
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:29,437
You'd think that they'd keep going

489
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:30,963
around you and get away from you,

490
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,618
but if you were strafing backwards,

491
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:34,018
then that means they're just trying

492
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:35,641
to get further back than you are.

493
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:37,459
I actually remembered it

494
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,757
with this clip right here,

495
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:41,093
I just watched it over and
over for some reason,

496
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:42,608
and at a certain point,

497
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:45,270
I just sort of understood the difference

498
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,152
between levels 4 and 1,

499
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:48,762
how they connect with each other

500
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:50,249
and how they can chain each other,

501
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:52,070
why they confused me so much.

502
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:54,039
This pyro was on level 4,

503
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:55,707
and I got this level 1 stab on him.

504
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:57,770
Of course, I didn't know any
of this at the time,

505
00:17:57,794 --> 00:18:00,199
but suddenly it all
started coming together.

506
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:02,808
So eventually, I'd just spin
around a little,

507
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,523
give him my back to just see

508
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,154
what the directions are, to see

509
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:07,680
which sides it happens from,

510
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:08,941
how it works.

511
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,510
Maybe, eventually I don't face him at all,

512
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,239
and turn it into a complete reverse stab,

513
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:16,061
just turned into a moonwalk.

514
00:18:16,757 --> 00:18:18,323
Maybe, eventually I realized that

515
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:20,392
sometimes I shouldn't fight so hard

516
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,174
to get behind someone, like this.

517
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:23,982
This guy's gonna be on level 4,

518
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,171
he's gonna get to my side,
I'm gonna get stuck,

519
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:28,233
I should just go for a slalom.

520
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:31,370
The level 4 stab was already a lost cause,

521
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:32,664
if you know it's not gonna work

522
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:34,106
you have this other option now.

523
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:35,868
And speaking of lost causes,

524
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:37,376
this guy is on 4.1,

525
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:39,686
I can't take the strafe wider than him,

526
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:42,080
but because I got this close to him

527
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:44,643
I'm able to go for the stab
from the other side.

528
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,133
This can also work against the impossible

529
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,581
level 4.2s, with how wide they

530
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,290
their strafe from one side,

531
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:53,846
you can go for the stab from
the other sometimes.

532
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:55,634
And of course, finally,

533
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,502
it can work against the 4.3s.

534
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Here I fail and go for a matador

535
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:01,340
he gets behind me and...

536
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:02,781
there we go!

537
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:05,951
So in short, this stab
works on every level,

538
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:08,707
it just happens to happen
at the exact moment

539
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,536
where every form of strafing

540
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,132
is forced for a second into
the same movement,

541
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:16,161
which is the moment after
their strafes succeed.

542
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:18,230
The moment they get behind you.

543
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,629
Now, usually when you get to a spy's back,

544
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:25,447
you're safe. I mean, it's the

545
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:26,858
opposite of what he wants.

546
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:28,941
But this stab, slalom,

547
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,737
happens inmediately after
they get behind you.

548
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,838
Let's take a look at this guy.

549
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,019
He's just gonna back off,

550
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:35,334
avoid the circlestrafe,

551
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,358
and just get stabbed straight after.

552
00:19:37,815 --> 00:19:39,705
Take a look at this guy, he's on level 4.

553
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:42,207
Really, the instant after
he gets behind me,

554
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:44,363
which is what he wanted, he dies.

555
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:47,406
Now, people don't really understand

556
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,681
how thin the border is between them

557
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:52,264
being behind you and you being behind them.

558
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,580
People don't even really notice it

559
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,581
or think about it, they just play.

560
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,155
If you almost get behind them

561
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,291
or if you get behind them.

562
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:01,146
They don't really think about it,

563
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,234
they'll just keep playing,

564
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,723
and they'll only notice it
when they get stabbed.

565
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,146
So those are people who don't really think

566
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,457
about these kinds of things

567
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:09,768
when they're running around.

568
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,411
But this stab is even more dangerous

569
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:14,435
for people who are thinking about it.

570
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:17,182
People who are completely
used to getting behind

571
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:18,997
other players, meaning they're used to

572
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:20,911
get behind people whenever they attempt to,

573
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:22,968
are more vulnerable to this stab,

574
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:25,931
because it abuses the fact that they know

575
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:27,279
that they'll stay behind you.

576
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:28,947
And when they don't, it comes

577
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:30,388
of as more of a surprise.

578
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,517
Now, I'm not just talking about spy,

579
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,815
I'm talking about every player

580
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,200
who is aggressive with his strafe,

581
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,503
and every player on the amazing levels.

582
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:39,151
People who know how to do it,

583
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:40,973
they know how to get behind people.

584
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:42,781
Those are the people who will

585
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,256
get surprised by this more.

586
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:47,145
Now, they are very familiar

587
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:48,894
with fighting a spy already.

588
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:49,922
Then know how to do it,

589
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:51,683
they know what the safe moments are,

590
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,813
they know they'll get to
your back eventually,

591
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:55,434
because you'll try to stab them.

592
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:57,296
And that's where slalom shines.

593
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:00,599
Now, eventually, this stab became a really

594
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,714
important clutch for me

595
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,683
against really good players.

596
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,565
This is one of my favorite stabs here.

597
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:07,866
It's against this guy,

598
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,401
I can't get to his back,

599
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,209
I even go for this reverse stab,

600
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,469
he stil lgets behind me,

601
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,360
but I can go for it from the other side.

602
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,402
You see, a lot of your failed stabs,

603
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:20,125
your best ones are going to be almost,

604
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:21,707
he's just gonna get a step back,

605
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,222
one step too far,

606
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:25,277
But using these means of recovery,

607
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,159
you can get literally anybody.

608
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:29,569
It's the end of the fight,
the edge of your strafe,

609
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:31,545
your very last trick.

610
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,079
Use it against the strongest

611
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:34,666
players with the best strafes.

612
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:36,682
For example, this guy is really good,

613
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:38,123
but suddenly he turns around,

614
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:39,631
he's on level 4, he gets behind me,

615
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:41,026
and then I get him.

616
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:42,661
And that's when I realized:

617
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:45,337
they don't have to be all that amazing

618
00:21:45,753 --> 00:21:47,145
for me to go for this stab.

619
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:49,761
Here I switch weapons,
and he gets behind me,

620
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,083
and I do it against him because

621
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:52,604
I just know where he will be.

622
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:54,066
I can get this stab on him.

623
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,408
See here, I'm just walking around

624
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:57,722
I get a stab on this guy,

625
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,377
try to stab this guy, didn't work out.

626
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,827
Yeah, but so far,

627
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:03,295
they all stayed in front of me,

628
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:05,319
everything goes kind of as planned.

629
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:06,451
I try to get behind this scout...

630
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:07,005
oh my god!

631
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,540
But I have a means of recovery.

632
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,463
I'm already used to doing this,

633
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,057
it doesn't have to be
scary to fail like this.

634
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,674
Here, I didn't even think

635
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:17,529
that he could react to me in time.

636
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:19,331
He does, he manages to pull away,

637
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:20,986
get behind me by surprise,

638
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,788
but I can use slalom

639
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:24,543
whenever I get surprised.

640
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,505
I can let me cross me over,

641
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,977
I can turn around, and go for

642
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,448
the stab from the other side.

643
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,800
Now, why does this stab always

644
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:34,266
happen with your back to the guy?

645
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,554
You can just turn around and

646
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:36,920
get him like that.

647
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:39,271
The thing is, about this stab, is that

648
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:40,659
it's a recovery technique,

649
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:42,981
it means that you've
commited to another stab,

650
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:45,005
you've turned for it, you've
thought you'd get it,

651
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:46,352
and then you didn't.

652
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,480
So now you accidentally

653
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,015
have your back to your opponent.

654
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:53,231
Now in case slalom fails,

655
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:54,807
if it's not too horrible,

656
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:56,081
you can keep going for it.

657
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,983
See here? He gets behind me,

658
00:22:58,007 --> 00:22:59,037
he gets behind me again,

659
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:00,318
there we go!

660
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:03,111
It's just a level 1 stab after all.

661
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:04,810
Let's have a look at this.

662
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,385
This guy is gonna take the corner wide

663
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:07,899
and get behind me by surprise.

664
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,362
Usually, I'd have to back up at this point

665
00:23:10,386 --> 00:23:12,386
to get him, but I can't right now,

666
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,658
because there is a wall,

667
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,923
so I just treat it as if

668
00:23:15,948 --> 00:23:17,976
he just got behind me again,

669
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,220
like I already failed the slalom.

670
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,120
Let's have another quick look.

671
00:23:22,144 --> 00:23:23,715
You really learn how to control

672
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,378
your environment, and things
outside of your view

673
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:27,933
the more you do this stab.

674
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:31,109
Now, because slalom works
in all forms of strafing,

675
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:33,592
it allows you to check for
somebody's level.

676
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,460
For example, I don't know what level

677
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:36,628
this medic is gonna be on,

678
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:37,949
I don't know what to do against him.

679
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,451
I don't know how to approach him,

680
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:41,246
I sort of just strafe derply,

681
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,828
trying to collide with him,

682
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,476
and he suddenly gets behind me

683
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,852
and at that point, I know what to do.

684
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,261
As it turns out, this guy was on level 4.

685
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:50,741
Aside from that, slalom

686
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:52,310
can also be used in corners.

687
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,065
If you go for a cornerstab,

688
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:55,574
and the other person takes it wide,

689
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:57,482
he can get behind you very easily.

690
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:00,372
And if you can't pull
backwards for a sideways

691
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:01,880
and backwards stab in time,

692
00:24:02,723 --> 00:24:03,783
you can use this.

693
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
Here for example, I just happened to walk

694
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,244
into the corner while he takes it wide

695
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:10,175
and I can't pull backwards in time.

696
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:12,938
Now he reacts perfectly, pulls out his gun,

697
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:15,173
and backs off, but it didn't matter.

698
00:24:15,757 --> 00:24:17,645
And also obviously, you can still use it

699
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:19,558
when they back up from the corner as well.

700
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:24,108
Also, for the most frustrating scenario

701
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:26,133
in trying to go for level 1 stabs,

702
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:27,487
is when you take it very wide

703
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:28,927
and the other guy is too shallow,

704
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:30,362
and then you take it shallow,

705
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,503
and he gets behind you.

706
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,199
Slalom can really save you.

707
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,328
So in short, for every scenario

708
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,796
where they get behind you,

709
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,217
you can use this.

710
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:42,027
Again, this is a recovery technique.

711
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,642
Here, me and this guy are both

712
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,290
gonna back off into the health room.

713
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:47,966
I try to go for a backpedal stab... I slip!

714
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,228
And he's on my other side.

715
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:52,490
So by getting used to slalom,

716
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:55,253
when you go for a stab,
even if you lose the guy,

717
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:57,475
you always know where he is.

718
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:59,851
Now, it could be for when
you fail the stab,

719
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,706
and he's very very close to you,

720
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,165
or it could be that he's just

721
00:25:03,189 --> 00:25:05,123
strafing around you from very far away,

722
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,758
but you still know the direction

723
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:08,260
from which he has to come from.

724
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:12,125
So by getting used to dealing

725
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:13,572
with people getting behind you

726
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,607
when you're fighting,
you get used to dealing

727
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:16,998
with people who are not even

728
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:18,390
on your screen to begin with:

729
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:20,579
other people that you've just heard

730
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,187
or felt on your side.

731
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:23,708
And that's where the true

732
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,357
potential of this stab is.

733
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:27,806
Teaching you and giving you a means

734
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:29,928
to dealing with multiple people.

735
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:31,307
You don't have to turn around

736
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:32,450
and start another stab,

737
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:33,872
you know where he is.

738
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,868
Dealing with more than one guy at once

739
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:38,892
is difficult, and that's natural,

740
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,525
but by getting used to it,

741
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,874
it can be as easy as when you're facing

742
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:44,449
one of those guys alone.

743
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:46,464
And by being able to use

744
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:47,973
your movement in succesion

745
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:49,588
and not have to turn around every

746
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:51,416
second fight for every single guy,

747
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:53,812
you can maximize your potential.

748
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:55,734
It's about being able to pay attention

749
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,315
to multiple people at once,

750
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,024
and by practising slalom,

751
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,549
by practising people getting

752
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:02,073
behind you from one direction,

753
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,449
you always know how to
get it from the other.

754
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,425
See, if you can just train yourself

755
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:09,449
to stab one guy while paying attention

756
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,062
to where the other one is,

757
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:13,193
then you're obviously not wasting any time

758
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,312
for those little moments

759
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:15,647
where he's a little careless

760
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,671
because you're fighting somebody else.

761
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,667
After stabbing somebody and turning around,

762
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:22,948
once the next player sees that,

763
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,322
he's going to get more careful

764
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,345
and you don't wanna miss
those little opportunities.

765
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:30,055
This is what slalom teaches you.

766
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:37,509
Ok cool, so we have all these stabs,

767
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:39,985
and all these things that
help us to get them.

768
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:42,320
But what happens when you don't

769
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:43,909
know what to do against a guy?

770
00:26:45,012 --> 00:26:47,058
Well, you can just go for a random stab

771
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:48,493
and hope that'll work out.

772
00:26:48,677 --> 00:26:50,424
I mean, we're pretty good at doing

773
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:52,090
all of this right now, right?

774
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,332
I've played spy for a long time,

775
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:55,854
I know how to circlestrafe.

776
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:59,031
And another one! Man, that was good.

777
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:01,792
But you see, when you have

778
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:03,214
no idea what you're doing,

779
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:04,987
you get baited into going for

780
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:06,639
stabs based in the moment.

781
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,755
You go for very intuitive stabs.

782
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:10,766
In the worst-case scenario, you're just

783
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,444
gonna start going for matadors,

784
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,313
and you are not stabbing anything

785
00:27:14,337 --> 00:27:15,747
until you stop doing that.

786
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:17,048
So we're going to have to

787
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:18,670
make a change in mindset.

788
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,515
Now, if you got a circlestrafe
stab on a guy here,

789
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,984
and you suddenly feel like going for a

790
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:27,959
level 4 stab the next time you see him,

791
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,307
then at the very least, although you

792
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:32,230
got a circlestrafe stab at one time,

793
00:27:32,254 --> 00:27:33,868
or even a lot of times, you don't

794
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,507
really understand what you're doing

795
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:37,055
because you don't understand

796
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,390
what the other player is doing.

797
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
And this is what this video is

798
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,481
going to focus on, the other player.

799
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:45,404
Well, to start us out,

800
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:48,139
it feels kinda pointless
repeating this, but

801
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:50,429
once you've figured out a person's level,

802
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:52,250
all you have to do is to keep going for

803
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,788
the same type of stab on him over and over.

804
00:27:55,312 --> 00:27:57,802
The next time he's gonna
airblast and turn and

805
00:27:58,248 --> 00:28:00,409
do all sorts of crazy shit but in the end,

806
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,594
he is going to get stabbed in the same way.

807
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:04,903
That's because changing your mindset

808
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,945
and even changing your movements

809
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,969
doesn't really change your movement.

810
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:11,116
Your level is what your fingers know

811
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:12,794
and it has nothing to do with what

812
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,471
you might or not know about it.

813
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:16,662
You're always bound by your level.

814
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:20,812
Remember this guy? He was there

815
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:23,948
throughout the entirety of
the level 1 section.

816
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,425
Might as well, put a tag over him.

817
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:28,039
Yeah, there we go.

818
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:30,228
As long as I face him...

819
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:31,946
No, as long as he's playing,

820
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,425
whether I stab him or not,

821
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:36,041
he's going to be moving like this.

822
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:38,009
But those last two stabs

823
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:39,471
were very different, right?

824
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:42,020
Well, you gotta remember
that the level itself,

825
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:44,422
even though it is essentially
the same movement,

826
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:47,058
stabs change according to the situation.

827
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:50,027
This scout is on 4.2, and
I just got him with

828
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,530
a really wide sideways and backwards stab.

829
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:54,586
But there he goes taking it wide again,

830
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:57,042
and again, and I get him again.

831
00:28:57,086 --> 00:28:59,118
And although executed differently,

832
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:00,865
those were the same stabs.

833
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:02,487
Again here, I try for the sideways

834
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:03,875
and backwards and it does not work,

835
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:06,858
he gets stuck over there,
but I still get him

836
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,900
with a manage-your-matador technique,

837
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:10,348
which is still level 4.

838
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,624
Although executed differently,

839
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:14,365
those stabs are the same.

840
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:16,741
The guy is still moving in the same way.

841
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:18,113
It doesn't change, it just

842
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:19,351
gets harder to deal with.

843
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:21,633
Here, I get this guy with a

844
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:23,288
pretty basic level 1 stab,

845
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,136
and the next time I face him, it already

846
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:27,572
has to be extended into a backpedal stab.

847
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,834
So the level doesn't change,

848
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:32,771
but if you find a moment
in which the other guy

849
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:35,028
is vulnerable to you movement-wise,

850
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,010
like here, he gets stuck on the wall

851
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:38,938
and then I level 4 him very easily,

852
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,913
that's something that does stay

853
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:42,487
the same most of the times.

854
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:44,282
I can get him stuck on the wall again

855
00:29:44,307 --> 00:29:45,818
and go for it one more time.

856
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:47,799
Ah, it didn't work out this time,

857
00:29:47,896 --> 00:29:51,082
but managed matador, level 4 stab.

858
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:52,594
The same people stay

859
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:54,425
vulnerable to the same strafes,

860
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:57,509
or specific strafes inside of their level.

861
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,537
And of course, without changing their level

862
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,713
they can get used to it, but it definitely

863
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:03,201
doesn't happen immediately.

864
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:04,409
That's why if you catch on

865
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:05,909
to something like that,

866
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,672
you'll be able to keep going

867
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:09,207
for it for quite a while.

868
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,736
Again, it's within the
boundaries of their level,

869
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,325
and it's a certain strafe that

870
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,525
they're vulnerable to, like

871
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,914
a wide strafe that makes

872
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,175
them gravitate into you.

873
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:19,571
It's not a certain trick or
tactic that you pull,

874
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:21,380
it's just a certain move

875
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:23,388
that they don't react well to or

876
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,677
they can't pull too well themselves.

877
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:28,309
Now of course, people still

878
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,014
can't change the way they move.

879
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,051
Even if they saw you
trying something before

880
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:35,315
they can expect it and react faster, but

881
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,382
they can't react to it any differently.

882
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:40,658
For example, this guy is on level 3/4.1.

883
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,720
He airblasts and he turns the strafe

884
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:44,329
when I try to level 3 him,

885
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:46,778
but eventually, I will outstrafe him.

886
00:30:47,414 --> 00:30:48,586
And it's gonna keep happening

887
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:49,741
in the same scenarios.

888
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,958
For example, when I stairstab this guy,

889
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:54,813
he lets me pass, and he's on level 4.

890
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,801
Now, he got stabbed, but that

891
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,843
doesn't mean that he stops doing it.

892
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,840
See this? I stairstab him, he lets me pass,

893
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,995
then he goes around me for the

894
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,897
kill, and this time he does get it.

895
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:08,505
And this is how you play from now on:

896
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:10,121
thinking about all of this.

897
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:13,270
When you don't know what to do,

898
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:14,933
when you encounter somebody new

899
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:16,741
you check for his level.

900
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:20,251
Try for something, expect it to not work,

901
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,336
look at the guy's movements,

902
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,115
and go for the correct stab.

903
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:26,918
With all these examples here,
the same thing happens,

904
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:29,681
I go for a moonwalk, which
is a level 1 stab,

905
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:31,476
and the guy lets me pass.

906
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,985
So I go for a level 4 stab right away.

907
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:35,892
The thing is, you can't expect to

908
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:37,634
get the first stab you try for,

909
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:39,685
you have to concentrate
on the other player,

910
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:41,344
collect information, try to

911
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:43,002
understand what he's doing.

912
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:45,990
Here again, he lets me pass
and turns completely,

913
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:48,576
so I know I have to go forwards

914
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,960
and backwards to get him.

915
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:52,443
All that being said,

916
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,032
if you are going for a matador,

917
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:55,620
they'll actually expect to get it.

918
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:57,221
Look at how the guy avoids it,

919
00:31:57,246 --> 00:31:58,567
look at what happened that

920
00:31:58,591 --> 00:31:59,911
caused you to not get it.

921
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,273
There's no reason to fail
three matadors in a

922
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,543
in a row like this

923
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:05,056
if the guy is obviously strafing.

924
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,197
So let's see another example again.

925
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:08,760
I'm going to go forwards and

926
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:10,181
backwards against this guy,

927
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,346
it's not gonna work, and I'm
going to try some

928
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:13,631
other stuff, and it's not gonna

929
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:15,820
work, and eventually, I stab him.

930
00:32:16,115 --> 00:32:18,614
But, it seriously didn't
need to go like that.

931
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,706
After that first try, he backed off

932
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,987
and that's all you need.

933
00:32:22,011 --> 00:32:24,682
That second fail was completely pointless,

934
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:26,537
and I'm lucky to not have died

935
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:28,393
by the time I could try again.

936
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,869
So let's see, I go for
forwards and backwards

937
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:32,597
at this guy, and it does not work,

938
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:33,791
but for the next time

939
00:32:34,428 --> 00:32:35,934
I know what will work.

940
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:37,629
Now obviously, going in for a

941
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:38,800
stab when you know that it's

942
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,125
not gonna work is dangerous,

943
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:41,481
so you can also understand

944
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:42,881
what the other person is doing

945
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:45,123
by watching him fight other people.

946
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,992
For example, for both these
guys he was fighting,

947
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:49,661
this scout was going around them.

948
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:51,699
So I know that I can go forwards

949
00:32:51,723 --> 00:32:53,284
and backwards in order to get him.

950
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:55,920
This spy here is fighting this pyro,

951
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,730
the pyro lets him pass, then
the spy stairstabs him,

952
00:32:58,754 --> 00:33:00,404
and the pyro lets him pass again, so

953
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:02,260
I know that all I need to do

954
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:05,056
is to go for some level 4 stab against him.

955
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,751
Avenge my spy.

956
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,841
Sometimes though, you need
more than one fight,

957
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:12,236
and more than one stab against the guy

958
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,865
to actually know what he's doing.

959
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:16,594
I went for some stuff on this
guy, it didn't work, and

960
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,210
I have no idea what this was.

961
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,300
Well, I can't really know
until I face him again.

962
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,505
Like this scout, I have no

963
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:26,104
idea what that stab was.

964
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:27,305
Was he strafing towards me?

965
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:29,213
 Was he just backing away into the corner?

966
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:32,143
People on every level do
that, so I don't know.

967
00:33:32,794 --> 00:33:34,794
Here, I luckily face him again,

968
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,688
and I can see that he's backing

969
00:33:36,712 --> 00:33:38,336
up and he's strafing towards me.

970
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,092
Had I known that before,

971
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:41,899
I would have tried to stab him there.

972
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:43,657
And obviously, afterwards, I do

973
00:33:43,681 --> 00:33:45,029
know what to do against him

974
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,566
So sometimes it's not gonna
be that obvious,

975
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,030
it's gonna take you more than one encounter

976
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:51,897
to figure out what the other guy is doing.

977
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,071
Even if you stab him,

978
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,700
it was some kind of circlestrafe-ish stab.

979
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,118
And you still don't know how

980
00:33:57,142 --> 00:33:58,516
to face him for the next times,

981
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,326
and stabbing him that one
time was meaningless.

982
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:04,715
You can spin around randomly,
go for a weird

983
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,039
stab from the front or from the back,

984
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:09,436
but if you don't know what you're doing,

985
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,235
none of this matters at all.

986
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,911
You have to know what
you're doing at all times

987
00:34:13,942 --> 00:34:16,369
so that you can keep trying
and so that you can

988
00:34:16,394 --> 00:34:18,141
capitalize on the opportunity when

989
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,232
it shows itself, to do what's correct.

990
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:22,116
You need to know the starting and

991
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,835
the ending point for each stab.

992
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:26,302
The fact that you spin doesn't

993
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:28,352
really change the nature of the stab.

994
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,376
Look at where it starts,
and look where it ends,

995
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,824
it's a pretty normal stab after all.

996
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:34,224
So you can go running and

997
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,013
shooting and being really fast,

998
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:37,809
But none of it will mean much

999
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,023
because there's no way you

1000
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:40,386
can repeat what you're doing

1001
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:42,447
if you don't know what you're doing.

1002
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,726
Also, when you're running

1003
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,849
and shooting randomly,

1004
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:47,812
you don't know when you'll
get to a person's side,

1005
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,355
or how you got to a person's

1006
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,489
side when it happens.

1007
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:52,513
See? I have no idea what
happened over there.

1008
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:54,727
And circlestrafing is about

1009
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:56,181
understanding just that.

1010
00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:57,769
It's easy to get to a person's side

1011
00:34:57,793 --> 00:34:59,357
by being really fast and everything,

1012
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,009
but really outstrafing him is

1013
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,660
a completely different matter.

1014
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,989
Your chances of actually

1015
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:05,536
getting someone substantial

1016
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,784
by just going left and right

1017
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,873
very fast are pretty low.

1018
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:10,841
I fight with this pyro a lot,

1019
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:12,368
and this is the only time I've

1020
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:14,191
ever gotten a stab like this on him.

1021
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,741
And even that wasn't exactly a matador.

1022
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:19,317
So I go for a level 4 stab over here,

1023
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,364
and sometimes you guess.

1024
00:35:20,388 --> 00:35:21,679
correctly on your first time.

1025
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,091
And the more you try to keep

1026
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:24,502
encountering the same people

1027
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:25,993
and noticing their movements,

1028
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:27,331
the better you get at it.

1029
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:29,180
You'll start getting an eye for it,

1030
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:32,009
you'll start noticing these
movements by reflex.

1031
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:33,685
I don't know what this guy is doing,

1032
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:34,779
but I see that he stepped

1033
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:35,953
sideways there for a second,

1034
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:38,496
and immediately, I know he's on level 4

1035
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,891
and I know what to do against him.

1036
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:42,109
Let's take a look at this
demoman over here.

1037
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:44,312
He backs up into a corner, but then

1038
00:35:44,337 --> 00:35:46,405
he lets me pass while shooting me.

1039
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:48,576
Now, this lets me know how he's gonna act

1040
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,561
the next time I'm gonna run into a corner.

1041
00:35:51,135 --> 00:35:53,324
Or let's take a look at this
pyro for a second.

1042
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,107
He could've kept going to my side,

1043
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:57,131
but he kept strafing at me.

1044
00:35:57,928 --> 00:35:59,928
Another example here on this spy.

1045
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:02,193
I just sort of back off when I see him,

1046
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:04,328
and he could've tried to go
around me over there,

1047
00:36:04,352 --> 00:36:06,003
but by seeing how he moves,

1048
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,286
I know what to do next.

1049
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:10,975
Now, this guy turns around on me

1050
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:13,778
and he keeps going around
me after he notices

1051
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:15,802
which makes me think he's level 4.

1052
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:18,393
Now usually after getting around you,

1053
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,925
they get around you again on level 4.

1054
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:22,949
But that was not the case, he backed up,

1055
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:25,172
which makes me think he's 4.1.

1056
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:28,219
So, I immediately start going
for the glue stab,

1057
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:30,243
he shows his back, but not quite.

1058
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:32,532
And there he goes, lets me pass again,

1059
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,865
but then he's going to back off

1060
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:35,499
and the glue works.

1061
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,497
Again, this guy is going
forwards and backwards

1062
00:36:39,727 --> 00:36:41,779
which is also 4.1, and

1063
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:43,649
I manage to outstrafe him

1064
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,263
more normally this time.

1065
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,299
So anyways, by continuing to

1066
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:49,540
notice other people's movements,

1067
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:51,656
you get better at reacting to

1068
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,578
it immediately and correctly,

1069
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:56,854
which will allow you to
capitalize on opportunities

1070
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:59,650
better and more often, without wasting time

1071
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,577
on understanding eventually how a

1072
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:03,983
player moves, dying to him every time.

1073
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,913
Or if death is inevitable in that situation

1074
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,474
you could at least bring out

1075
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:09,827
the other player's movements

1076
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:11,963
to know what to do against
him the next times.

1077
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,998
Also, it means that you can

1078
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:15,955
obviously just try to understand what

1079
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,408
he's doing while shooting him,

1080
00:37:17,432 --> 00:37:18,626
for the future where

1081
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,844
shooting would be impractical

1082
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:22,450
or in situations like this where shooting

1083
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,649
was not that practical from the beginning.

1084
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:27,051
With everything you do, you're supposed

1085
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:29,293
to try to bring out the
other players' levels.

1086
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:30,848
Bring out their movements,

1087
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:32,023
see how they're avoiding you

1088
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:34,358
at all times, whether you're
going to stab them

1089
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:35,626
or whether you're going to die.

1090
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:38,710
I think that this is how we should play.

1091
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,133
Now, in our new little playstyle,

1092
00:37:42,408 --> 00:37:44,408
I wanna talk to you about
something important.

1093
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:46,299
And that's understanding which

1094
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:47,658
stabs were good for you to get

1095
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:49,200
and which stabs were not.

1096
00:37:50,091 --> 00:37:52,436
Some stabs just sort of happen,

1097
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:53,850
because you've played with

1098
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:54,979
the person for long enough,

1099
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:57,688
so eventually, you're going
to stab him somehow.

1100
00:37:57,838 --> 00:37:59,895
And as the quality of that player rises

1101
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:01,932
it's most likely to be some stab

1102
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:03,948
that had nothing to do with anything.

1103
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:05,528
It just sort of happened.

1104
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:07,967
There's no point in dying to

1105
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:09,520
someone six thousand times

1106
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:12,016
only so you can kill him
once later with some

1107
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:14,289
really funny and weird stab.

1108
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:16,522
You wanna figure out what to do against

1109
00:38:16,553 --> 00:38:18,296
the person, so when he comes for you again

1110
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:19,604
you'll be ready.

1111
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:22,079
Again, some stabs you need to know

1112
00:38:22,106 --> 00:38:24,123
what you're doing in order to get them

1113
00:38:24,226 --> 00:38:26,404
as it's happening. But in the long run

1114
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:28,254
they're still not gonna help you

1115
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:29,880
at all for other situations.

1116
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:32,532
Then there's stabs which you

1117
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:33,664
have no idea what you're doing,

1118
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:35,406
but you can learn a lot from them.

1119
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:38,709
And then there's stabs which are just like:

1120
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,533
"Oh some shit accidentally
happened and uh...

1121
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,227
whatever I guess"

1122
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,830
Nothing to be learnt and
nothing to be repeated.

1123
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:48,599
Now, moving on as to regarding

1124
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,741
why we can repeat strafestabs.

1125
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:53,978
I've said this before,

1126
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:56,934
but getting outstrafed just feels weird.

1127
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,370
The guy just runs into you

1128
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:01,695
and you're sort of just helpless about it.

1129
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:03,995
Now, it has nothing to do

1130
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,671
with you expecting or not expecting

1131
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:08,012
him to run at you.

1132
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:10,347
It's just that he runs at you in a way,

1133
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,651
in a specific way, which
counters what you do.

1134
00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:15,921
And that's the difference between

1135
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:17,668
a trickstab and a strafestab,

1136
00:39:17,692 --> 00:39:19,517
the circlestrafe stabs.

1137
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:20,905
When you get trickstabed, you

1138
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,613
sort of just facepalm yourself,

1139
00:39:22,976 --> 00:39:24,528
and then it doesn't happen again.

1140
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:26,240
It's like: "No duh, I shouldn't

1141
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,558
have followed him up there."

1142
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:29,233
And a spy is usually not gonna

1143
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:30,688
be able to outsmart you again,

1144
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:32,676
after you are already aware of him.

1145
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:34,819
But when it comes to outstrafing,

1146
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,634
that's a completely different story.

1147
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:38,529
If he can read your movements,

1148
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:40,397
then it's a completely different story.

1149
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:41,545
And that's because he's not

1150
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,481
betting on you being stupid.

1151
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:45,806
When you're circlestrafing,
you're not betting

1152
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,019
on the other player
being stupid or clumsy

1153
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:49,474
or anything like that.

1154
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:51,651
You're betting on him acting smart.

1155
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:54,432
And on doing whatever he can to avoid you.

1156
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:56,503
And by doing so, you exhaust

1157
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,342
his best type of movement,

1158
00:39:58,511 --> 00:39:59,904
instead of gambling on him

1159
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:02,173
using a bad type of movement.

1160
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:04,923
Trickstabs are tricking a person

1161
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,831
into running directly at you,

1162
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:08,855
and to avoid a trickstab

1163
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,879
a person has to strafe away from it.

1164
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:12,290
Technically there's no such

1165
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:13,931
thing as avoiding a stab,

1166
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:15,052
there's just strafing.

1167
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,408
And since you're prepared to outstrafe him,

1168
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,821
to counter his strafing
in the first place,

1169
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:23,026
then that's the
difference between

1170
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,229
a circlestrafe stab
and a trickstab.

1171
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:26,290
It's a difference between

1172
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:27,872
outsmarting and outstrafing.

1173
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:29,576
Now of course, some trickstabs

1174
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,828
are a little more strafe-y,

1175
00:40:30,852 --> 00:40:32,006
and some strafestabs are

1176
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,184
a little more like tricks,

1177
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:35,052
but you get the general idea.

1178
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:37,034
If you both know about
the trick that you're

1179
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:38,969
going to try, then
it's not gonna work.

1180
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,299
But knowing about a strafestab

1181
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,140
isn't a way to prevent it.

1182
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,536
When you see a spy, you're
gonna try to avoid him,

1183
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,977
you're gonna try to avoid a stab,

1184
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,403
and then you're going to keep
trying to avoid a stab,

1185
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:50,816
and he's either gonna get

1186
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,243
you or he's not gonna get you.

1187
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:54,578
And that's all there is to it, really.

1188
00:40:54,695 --> 00:40:56,147
Now, there is a trade-off though.

1189
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:58,171
Once you've tricked the
person into running at you

1190
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:00,206
it's easy to stab him. But if you're

1191
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:01,445
trying to outstrafe him,

1192
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:03,414
even if initially you were in an

1193
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:05,313
optimal position to get the stab

1194
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,631
and he is strafing the
way you're expecting,

1195
00:41:07,855 --> 00:41:10,621
it's obviously much much harder to get it.

1196
00:41:11,017 --> 00:41:12,596
Strafestabs are generally

1197
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,452
more clutchy than trickstabs.

1198
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:16,763
You need to mess
with timing angles

1199
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:18,562
that vary from person to person,

1200
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:21,432
and even then it's pretty risky to go for.

1201
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:22,740
The only thing you can really

1202
00:41:22,765 --> 00:41:24,008
do about it is practise.

1203
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,509
Get the feel for it.

1204
00:41:26,006 --> 00:41:27,294
And obviously, figure out

1205
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,606
if the person you're facing

1206
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,630
is even worth it to begin with.

1207
00:41:34,094 --> 00:41:36,348
Now, if you do change what you do

1208
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:38,869
against a player, it
has to have a reason,

1209
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:41,073
especially if you already know his level.

1210
00:41:41,477 --> 00:41:44,161
For example this guy, I know
that he's on 3/4,

1211
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:46,185
and usually tries to outstrafe me with it.

1212
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,893
But I can see here that
he's just letting me pass

1213
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:51,222
every time I try going for his side, so

1214
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,738
I just go for a level 4 stab on him.

1215
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,177
Here I fail the stab against this

1216
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:57,855
guy because I was trying to, like, jump

1217
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:59,703
and make it very hard to avoid,

1218
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,632
trying to take the inside of the corner,

1219
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,122
but I did get behind him. So next time

1220
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,439
I'll just try to make it a little steadier.

1221
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:09,466
Here again, I just fail it, sort of,

1222
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,105
I missclick, but that doesn't

1223
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,743
mean anything has to change,

1224
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:14,325
I should just go for it again,

1225
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:15,748
and there we go!

1226
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:17,097
Things like you didn't click

1227
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:18,502
because you didn't have confidence

1228
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:19,967
for a strafestab shouldn't

1229
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:21,432
change it for the next time.

1230
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:23,275
If you missclick a trickstab, then the

1231
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,355
guy is gonna know from now on:

1232
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:26,944
"Oh, I'm not gonna go near
that place anymore."

1233
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:29,440
But with a strafestab, it doesn't change.

1234
00:42:29,643 --> 00:42:30,855
He'll keep doing whatever

1235
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,976
he can to avoid you,

1236
00:42:32,124 --> 00:42:33,564
you're going to try to outstrafe him,

1237
00:42:33,588 --> 00:42:34,952
and that's all there is to it.

1238
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:36,958
Now, you're also going to

1239
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:38,335
have to start paying attention

1240
00:42:38,612 --> 00:42:40,451
to how your stabs fail.

1241
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:43,073
You need to know why what
you did didn't work.

1242
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,641
For example here, it looked

1243
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:45,896
like he turned the strafe,

1244
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,831
but in actuality

1245
00:42:47,855 --> 00:42:49,674
he just got stuck there for a second,

1246
00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:52,763
which forced him to turn at
me in a different way

1247
00:42:52,913 --> 00:42:54,444
so I know I can backpedal

1248
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:56,000
stab him safely, normally.

1249
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,590
Sometimes, tiny angles and registration

1250
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:01,614
can rob you of your stabs, but

1251
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:03,684
again you should give up on it and

1252
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,576
you shouldn't change
what you're doing,

1253
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,600
because it was the correct stab.

1254
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:09,827
A lot of tiny things like that

1255
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:10,861
can make you think like the

1256
00:43:10,886 --> 00:43:12,663
other person is unstabable

1257
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:14,687
and you should give up,
but that's just wrong.

1258
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,861
The angle happened to be slightly off

1259
00:43:16,981 --> 00:43:18,523
and he got a crit, it doesn't

1260
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:20,090
mean I can't go for it anymore.

1261
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:21,728
He also couldn't have learnt anything

1262
00:43:21,752 --> 00:43:23,367
from almost getting stabbed there,

1263
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,542
because for him it was
what he was planning.

1264
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:27,853
But again, stabbing him for the next times

1265
00:43:28,303 --> 00:43:30,027
just might be a little harder.

1266
00:43:31,884 --> 00:43:33,379
Now, another very annoying

1267
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:34,898
thing that can confuse you

1268
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:36,497
are the levels overlapping

1269
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:37,975
at some specific points.

1270
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:39,330
You know how you can stab two

1271
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:41,178
people with the same type of stab

1272
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,100
if they're on the same level, right?

1273
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:45,124
Well, it gets incredibly confusing

1274
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:46,904
when you stab the same people

1275
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:49,366
on different levels with the same move.

1276
00:43:49,956 --> 00:43:51,215
I mean, look at this here.

1277
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,731
This guy is on level 1,
this guy is on level 4,

1278
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:55,823
and I manage to stab them both in

1279
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:58,022
succession like this,
with the same move.

1280
00:43:58,278 --> 00:43:59,580
Now, this can confuse you,

1281
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:00,905
but you have to remember

1282
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:03,127
that this is just one specific case.

1283
00:44:03,151 --> 00:44:05,362
Usually, the same type of movement

1284
00:44:05,386 --> 00:44:07,725
would not work against these two players.

1285
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:09,647
So you have to not get confused

1286
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:11,671
by the stabs you do get on people.

1287
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:13,931
For example, here with this scout

1288
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:16,325
I get the stab by predicting spots,

1289
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,775
like he was on level 3.

1290
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:19,243
While really, this is the only

1291
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:20,597
time he would've moved like this,

1292
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:22,052
he was actually on level 1.

1293
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,087
Stabbing somebody once doesn't mean

1294
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:25,956
that you have all of them figured out.

1295
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,445
You have to doubt it a little bit

1296
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:29,473
and take other things into consideration.

1297
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,508
Here, I go for forwards
and backwards

1298
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:33,230
against this pyro who's on level 1.

1299
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:35,594
He has fast reflexes, so he manages

1300
00:44:35,618 --> 00:44:38,115
to strafe back into
me in time anyways.

1301
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,776
Or like this spy. I go forwards

1302
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,999
and backwards against him,

1303
00:44:42,023 --> 00:44:43,377
but I was just decloaking there,

1304
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:44,541
he didn't see me at first.

1305
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:47,765
Both of these were not level 4 stabs.

1306
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,310
And even if someone on a certain level

1307
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:52,376
decides to put his
back against the wall,

1308
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,832
it doesn't mean he's suddenly on level 4.

1309
00:44:54,856 --> 00:44:56,856
He's still just gonna fall for the stab

1310
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,449
corresponding with this level.

1311
00:44:59,726 --> 00:45:01,278
So oftentimes you'll get confused.

1312
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:02,833
Let's take a look here,

1313
00:45:03,017 --> 00:45:04,688
I get a stab on this pyro and

1314
00:45:04,712 --> 00:45:06,383
it looks like a level 4 stab.

1315
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:08,587
This is what I thought
about when I stabbed him.

1316
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,381
But it could have also been

1317
00:45:10,405 --> 00:45:11,935
that he just crossed me over,

1318
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:13,577
and it just happened kind of

1319
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:15,339
slowly because he was surprised.

1320
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:17,721
He could be actually on level 1.

1321
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:19,276
There's no way for me to

1322
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,511
know until I see him again.

1323
00:45:20,535 --> 00:45:22,012
I see that he's backing off, he's

1324
00:45:22,036 --> 00:45:23,514
strafing backwards, meaning that

1325
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,968
he is on level 1.

1326
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,836
So I know I can't go for the

1327
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,585
forwards and backwards stabs on him

1328
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:31,515
I have to pull the level 1
stabs against him alone.

1329
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:37,047
Ok, so sometimes we can
get some confusing stabs,

1330
00:45:37,298 --> 00:45:39,298
and admittedly, sometimes you will just see

1331
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,512
things that are just not adding up,

1332
00:45:41,683 --> 00:45:43,683
and you will not understand any of it.

1333
00:45:44,053 --> 00:45:45,936
For example, this scout lets me pass,

1334
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,511
so he's on level 4, right?

1335
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:49,993
But then he just keeps
backing off, and then

1336
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:51,635
I get him with a level 1 stab.

1337
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:53,630
So, what the hell?

1338
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:55,868
Now apparently, he was just going for

1339
00:45:55,892 --> 00:45:57,634
the health when he let me pass there.

1340
00:45:57,962 --> 00:45:59,745
And there are a lot of specifics

1341
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:01,552
like this, like teammates and health,

1342
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:03,827
which could make a player move differently

1343
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:05,309
from what he usually would.

1344
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:07,932
For example, this guy here moves very

1345
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:10,227
carelessly against me
because he has a teammate,

1346
00:46:10,252 --> 00:46:11,474
usually I would have not been

1347
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,063
able to stab him this easily.

1348
00:46:13,652 --> 00:46:15,148
Now, the most confusing things

1349
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,667
you'll encounter are things that

1350
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,509
were never on your screen to begin with

1351
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:20,041
or that you had no way of

1352
00:46:20,065 --> 00:46:22,059
knowing about in the first place.

1353
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:24,108
For example, this guy here is my friend,

1354
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:26,497
and he is moving a little derply.

1355
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:28,155
After this happened, he told me that

1356
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:29,813
his screen froze there for a second,

1357
00:46:29,837 --> 00:46:31,442
which makes sense, because usually I

1358
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:33,070
would've never been able to stab him

1359
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:35,425
this easily and with a matador.

1360
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,229
Alright, moving on in
the confusion section,

1361
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:41,291
let's take a look at this sniper.

1362
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:43,106
He goes around me with level 4,

1363
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,075
he does it again,

1364
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,516
now I know what to do against him.

1365
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,305
But suddenly, he stops,

1366
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:51,175
he's not doing it anymore.

1367
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,199
How can that be?

1368
00:46:54,122 --> 00:46:55,873
Well, apparently different

1369
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,055
weapons are handled differently

1370
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,409
and used differently.

1371
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:02,379
So that sniper was on level 4 with his SMG,

1372
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,434
and on level 1 with his other weapons.

1373
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,538
Let's take a look at this
scout, he's on level 4,

1374
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:09,519
then he pulls out his scattergun,

1375
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:10,788
he starts backing off.

1376
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:12,937
It seems kind of contradictory,

1377
00:47:13,341 --> 00:47:15,565
but here he backs off with
his scattergun again,

1378
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,157
then he pulls out his pistol,

1379
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:18,422
starts going around me,

1380
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:21,311
and I get him with a
nice little level 4 stab.

1381
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,135
So, with the pistol, he was on level 4,

1382
00:47:24,452 --> 00:47:26,452
with his scattergun, he was on level 1.

1383
00:47:27,275 --> 00:47:28,896
So you have to take other weapons

1384
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,541
into account while figuring out

1385
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:31,889
a player's movement set.

1386
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:33,604
It's not them changing strategy,

1387
00:47:33,628 --> 00:47:35,212
it's just them changing gears.

1388
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:36,837
They might naturally move

1389
00:47:36,861 --> 00:47:38,909
differently once they change weapons.

1390
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:41,398
Remember this guy? He's on 3/4.

1391
00:47:41,773 --> 00:47:43,393
Well, it's hard to get him
with those stabs,

1392
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:45,417
but once he pulls out his melee weapon,

1393
00:47:45,587 --> 00:47:46,836
he's just on level 1,

1394
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:50,100
which is by comparison, way easier on us.

1395
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:51,368
So understanding different

1396
00:47:51,393 --> 00:47:53,397
weapons can work in your favor.

1397
00:47:53,421 --> 00:47:55,421
Here again, this guy is on 4.2,

1398
00:47:55,578 --> 00:47:57,948
then he pulls out his melee
and he's on level 1,

1399
00:47:58,518 --> 00:48:00,090
not nearly as bad for us.

1400
00:48:00,553 --> 00:48:02,553
This guy here again, he's on 4.2,

1401
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:04,581
then he pulls out his shotgun,

1402
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:05,996
and he's on level 1.

1403
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,126
So again, here this guy with the degreaser,

1404
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,668
we've already seen him
before, he's on level 4,

1405
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:13,650
then he pulls out his shotgun and

1406
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:15,472
I can pull a circlestrafe on him:

1407
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:16,867
level 1 with his shotgun.

1408
00:48:17,237 --> 00:48:18,728
With his degreaser, I'll only be

1409
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:20,484
able to get him with a level 4 stab,

1410
00:48:20,508 --> 00:48:22,106
and with his shotgun
I'm only going to

1411
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:24,074
be able to get him
with a level 1 stab.

1412
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,710
Also something you have
to take into account

1413
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:28,570
some people can't use some

1414
00:48:28,594 --> 00:48:30,207
of their weapons very well,

1415
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,801
especially on pubs and

1416
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,644
especially with melee weapons.

1417
00:48:33,668 --> 00:48:35,289
Some people don't even have a level,

1418
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:37,307
they'll just run at you
and get matadored.

1419
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,882
While again, with their other weapons

1420
00:48:38,906 --> 00:48:40,717
they could be way better at using those.

1421
00:48:41,428 --> 00:48:42,819
Again, nothing to say about

1422
00:48:42,844 --> 00:48:44,608
melee weapons in particular.

1423
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:45,928
Some people are actually

1424
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:47,684
harder to stab with their melee

1425
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,708
as opposed to with their ranged weapon,

1426
00:48:49,732 --> 00:48:51,348
but it's something to consider.

1427
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:54,091
Alright, so that was weapons.

1428
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,573
A person's level can
change with his weapon,

1429
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:58,451
so it could obviously change

1430
00:48:58,475 --> 00:49:00,150
with his class too, right?

1431
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,179
If different weapons handle differently,

1432
00:49:02,203 --> 00:49:04,249
then entirely different classes

1433
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,076
can handle differently, obviously.

1434
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,406
So sometimes, somebody changing his class

1435
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,228
means that you're starting from scratch

1436
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:13,343
when it comes to figuring
out what he's doing.

1437
00:49:13,966 --> 00:49:16,084
Or not. This guy, engie or

1438
00:49:16,108 --> 00:49:18,225
pyro, he's still on level 1.

1439
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,520
But still, fighting a pyro is

1440
00:49:19,544 --> 00:49:20,991
different from fighting an engie

1441
00:49:21,288 --> 00:49:22,359
or is it?

1442
00:49:23,376 --> 00:49:24,575
Let's have a look here.

1443
00:49:24,805 --> 00:49:27,224
He manages to get behind
me with the shotgun,

1444
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:28,979
and then he pulls out his melee being

1445
00:49:29,003 --> 00:49:30,734
so close to me, then he gets stabbed.

1446
00:49:31,044 --> 00:49:32,588
Now let's take another look at what

1447
00:49:32,612 --> 00:49:34,157
happened to him as engie before.

1448
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:36,606
See? He's shooting me, he gets behind me,

1449
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,034
once I get up to his face,

1450
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,463
he pulls out his melee again.

1451
00:49:39,632 --> 00:49:40,871
It's exactly the same.

1452
00:49:41,188 --> 00:49:43,313
He was even capable of avoiding

1453
00:49:43,337 --> 00:49:45,255
the first stab the same way.

1454
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:46,249
Now, I get it, it could be

1455
00:49:46,273 --> 00:49:47,484
something completely different

1456
00:49:47,508 --> 00:49:48,672
even if they stay on the

1457
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:50,220
same level across classes.

1458
00:49:50,244 --> 00:49:51,648
This guy changed to pyro and

1459
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:53,076
suddenly his forward strafe

1460
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,694
turned into a sideways strafe,

1461
00:49:54,844 --> 00:49:57,648
as a soldier he's already only backing off.

1462
00:49:58,558 --> 00:50:00,480
Although it just made
sense for this guy

1463
00:50:00,504 --> 00:50:02,426
to do these things
in these situations,

1464
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,194
you should still pay attention to

1465
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:06,244
people's names after they switch.

1466
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:08,645
Alright, moving on.

1467
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:11,590
Really, the number one thing

1468
00:50:11,614 --> 00:50:13,050
that will cause you confusion

1469
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:14,414
when you're trying to figure out

1470
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:15,779
another player's movements

1471
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:17,474
are the corners.

1472
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:19,339
This is that guy from the level 1

1473
00:50:19,363 --> 00:50:20,911
section by the way, remember him?

1474
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:23,095
Got him with a level 4 stab here.

1475
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:25,149
Ok, so I guess it's already
kind of annoying,

1476
00:50:25,173 --> 00:50:28,085
so let's leave the psychology
part out of this.

1477
00:50:28,455 --> 00:50:30,338
Apparently, turning out in the open

1478
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:32,189
when you want to or you have to

1479
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:34,381
is different from when the road

1480
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:36,293
ahead of you itself is turning.

1481
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:38,063
Meaning that when there's a turn,

1482
00:50:38,088 --> 00:50:39,302
 when there's a corner,

1483
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,998
people are going to be moving differently

1484
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:43,654
from what they usually would,

1485
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:46,296
which leads to a huge amount of confusion

1486
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:48,612
when you're trying to
understand their movements.

1487
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:50,326
For example this guy, lets me

1488
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,875
pass a whole bunch of times,

1489
00:50:52,118 --> 00:50:53,844
but then he gets backpedaled stabbed.

1490
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:55,921
Then it happens again, and

1491
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,629
apparently now,

1492
00:50:57,868 --> 00:50:58,983
I got another stab on him

1493
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:00,337
and... what's going on?

1494
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:02,621
His movements appear to be random.

1495
00:51:02,965 --> 00:51:04,261
But once we include the

1496
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:06,002
corners into this equation,

1497
00:51:06,198 --> 00:51:08,198
it becomes clear. Let's have a look.

1498
00:51:08,582 --> 00:51:09,813
When this guy is turning

1499
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:11,481
corners he's ready to back off,

1500
00:51:11,965 --> 00:51:14,938
but usually he's on level 4,
so he lets me pass.

1501
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:17,361
And here again, he's in the corner, so

1502
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:18,969
he backs off again.

1503
00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:21,192
Suddenly it makes sense.

1504
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:24,147
Here we're out in the
open, so he lets me pass,

1505
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:26,316
and this is not a level 1 stab,

1506
00:51:26,341 --> 00:51:28,632
he saw that I'm running directly at him,

1507
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:32,195
so he decided to use the
corner like level 4s do,

1508
00:51:32,612 --> 00:51:34,044
to try and outstrafe me.

1509
00:51:34,147 --> 00:51:35,801
Now, because he's on level 4

1510
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,172
he outstrafes me here,

1511
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,302
and again, he tries to let me pass

1512
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:40,493
by going left and right,

1513
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:41,736
which is what happened there.

1514
00:51:42,372 --> 00:51:44,294
So this guy is just on level 4,

1515
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:46,383
who happens to back away from corners.

1516
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,573
Ok, so we got this guy figured out,

1517
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:52,422
but the biggest and main
problem with all of this

1518
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:54,171
is that, from our perspective,

1519
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:56,006
what he sees as a turn

1520
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,448
isn't necessarily what we see as a turn,

1521
00:51:58,545 --> 00:51:59,683
meaning that I could get the

1522
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:01,818
level 4 stab on this medic once,

1523
00:52:01,842 --> 00:52:04,016
and then I could just assume I could

1524
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:05,949
keep getting it on him every time.

1525
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:08,518
But in reality, this guy is on level 1,

1526
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:11,248
he would never ever go around me,

1527
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:12,682
unless there's a turn.

1528
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:16,087
Which means that he saw this
bottom-of-the-stairs place

1529
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:18,648
where I stabbed him as a turn, as a corner,

1530
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:20,672
which is why he took it wide.

1531
00:52:20,697 --> 00:52:22,612
Just like here, he takes this place wide

1532
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:23,967
because it is a corner,

1533
00:52:24,543 --> 00:52:25,869
but the rest of the time he's

1534
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:28,471
always always going to be on level 1.

1535
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:31,203
Now, all of this is a huge problem for you

1536
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:32,569
when you're trying to identify

1537
00:52:32,593 --> 00:52:33,884
what the other guy does,

1538
00:52:34,134 --> 00:52:36,486
because you don't see
things the way he does,

1539
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,762
and there are corners
everywhere in this game.

1540
00:52:38,885 --> 00:52:40,253
So you're really going to

1541
00:52:40,277 --> 00:52:41,645
have to pay close attention.

1542
00:52:41,821 --> 00:52:43,914
But all of this confusion aside,

1543
00:52:43,938 --> 00:52:45,938
I really found that C2C,

1544
00:52:46,402 --> 00:52:48,872
this technique that focuses on the corner,

1545
00:52:49,222 --> 00:52:50,934
really works on anyone,

1546
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,257
because it already forces

1547
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:53,790
them into so many situations

1548
00:52:53,814 --> 00:52:55,814
where their strafe is vulnerable to you.

1549
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:58,301
If somebody is too hard
to stab on the outside,

1550
00:52:58,637 --> 00:52:59,943
you're going to be able to stab

1551
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,598
him on the corner at some point.

1552
00:53:03,108 --> 00:53:06,109
Alright damn, so let's pause
here for a second.

1553
00:53:08,925 --> 00:53:13,962
(Go to 53:28 to skip the pause)

1554
00:53:28,726 --> 00:53:30,726
We've learnt a whole bunch of ways here

1555
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,871
of understanding another
player's movement set,

1556
00:53:32,896 --> 00:53:34,404
about understanding his level.

1557
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:35,605
But with these levels,

1558
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,587
this tutorial really generalizes,

1559
00:53:37,671 --> 00:53:39,671
and you have to understand that stabbing,

1560
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:42,172
that movement, that dealing with somebody

1561
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:44,227
is about the individual.

1562
00:53:44,364 --> 00:53:46,036
You can't exactly walk around

1563
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,138
expecting everybody to be the same.

1564
00:53:48,281 --> 00:53:50,067
This is the mistake that spies usually

1565
00:53:50,092 --> 00:53:51,968
do by just trying to matador everything.

1566
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:54,418
So let's slowly get into that.

1567
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:55,719
We've talked about people's

1568
00:53:55,743 --> 00:53:57,173
habits while taking the corner,

1569
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:59,189
and how understanding this habit

1570
00:53:59,213 --> 00:54:01,691
is a big part of understanding
his movement set.

1571
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:03,239
But let's take it a bit further.

1572
00:54:03,749 --> 00:54:05,074
For example, I've noticed

1573
00:54:05,098 --> 00:54:06,636
that this pyro has the habit

1574
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:08,838
of blasting me up against
the wall, shooting,

1575
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:11,015
and then finishing me off with his melee.

1576
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,876
Now, usually I won't be able to do this,

1577
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,272
but a lot of the times I

1578
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:16,781
actually end up on his head when I die.

1579
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,738
So maybe if I expect it,

1580
00:54:18,762 --> 00:54:20,497
I can use this to my advantage.

1581
00:54:20,854 --> 00:54:23,380
I can start expecting this to happen.

1582
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:26,009
Let's have a look at a more unique habit.

1583
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:28,298
This is my friend here,
and while I'm fighting him

1584
00:54:28,322 --> 00:54:29,957
a lot of the times he runs

1585
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:31,615
away with his back to me

1586
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,972
in order to restart
the fight with better

1587
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:35,732
positioning and without looking at me.

1588
00:54:36,295 --> 00:54:37,564
But he can actually do it

1589
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:39,062
to a point where I expect it,

1590
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:41,431
and to a point where by looking at me

1591
00:54:41,455 --> 00:54:43,493
he would have actually not gotten stabbed.

1592
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:45,695
Sometimes he really does it

1593
00:54:45,726 --> 00:54:47,498
for fun, because it is funny.

1594
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:49,566
But he does it pretty
much against everyone

1595
00:54:49,677 --> 00:54:51,588
and also across all classes,

1596
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:53,612
in a way in that I can just sort of expect

1597
00:54:53,636 --> 00:54:55,398
to run at him and get a backstab.

1598
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:59,255
For another example, this scout is on 4.1,

1599
00:54:59,552 --> 00:55:02,165
I get a pretty lucky stab on him over here,

1600
00:55:02,562 --> 00:55:04,321
no glue required or anything.

1601
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:05,791
And getting the glue stab

1602
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:07,184
on him would've been really hard,

1603
00:55:07,227 --> 00:55:08,905
but I noticed, a lot of the times,

1604
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:10,607
while he was fighting other players

1605
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:12,342
that he has a habit of standing still.

1606
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,284
Meaning that I know
that I'm going to gain

1607
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:16,566
some distance on him
while he doesn't on me.

1608
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,888
Let's take a look at this guy.

1609
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:21,191
He's sort of jumping
sideways over and over,

1610
00:55:21,215 --> 00:55:23,787
I just time it so that I
could stab him with it,

1611
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:25,511
and it's a very shallow

1612
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:27,303
strafe as well when he jumps.

1613
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,114
Now, when he changes classes,
 he does it again.

1614
00:55:30,347 --> 00:55:31,636
Some habits a player can

1615
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,109
have with multiple classes.

1616
00:55:33,312 --> 00:55:34,437
Now, a player can also have

1617
00:55:34,462 --> 00:55:36,066
a habit of acting differently

1618
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,125
in a specific spot,

1619
00:55:37,149 --> 00:55:38,515
kind of like in corners.

1620
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:40,897
For example, this guy
always goes around me,

1621
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:43,233
but in this particular staircase,

1622
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,888
I know that he backs away.

1623
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:47,310
A player can also have a habit of taking

1624
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:49,512
a specific route which he can go through.

1625
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:52,068
Last time I was on this
roof I expected the scout

1626
00:55:52,092 --> 00:55:53,937
to follow me up there the normal way

1627
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:55,031
through the staircase.

1628
00:55:55,055 --> 00:55:57,614
But now I know he can
jump up these windows.

1629
00:55:57,638 --> 00:55:59,197
And if I expect it, I can make

1630
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:00,557
it more difficult for him, and

1631
00:56:01,035 --> 00:56:03,233
maybe work my way into
getting a stab on him.

1632
00:56:04,437 --> 00:56:06,316
But speaking of actual spots

1633
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,219
and places and more generally,

1634
00:56:08,244 --> 00:56:10,381
you can try to understand where it's

1635
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:12,541
easier for a player to use his level.

1636
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:15,109
It could very well be
that in a tighter spot,

1637
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:17,273
it will be harder for
him to move around.

1638
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:19,275
By understanding
this and purposely

1639
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,424
meeting him in a tight spot,

1640
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:22,866
you can get him easily.

1641
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,421
And it goes the other way around too.

1642
00:56:25,445 --> 00:56:27,445
For some players, while out in the open

1643
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:28,753
their movements become

1644
00:56:28,777 --> 00:56:30,473
sluggish and easy to counter.

1645
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:32,028
If somebody killed you a whole

1646
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:33,803
bunch of times in the same spot.

1647
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:36,159
you have to start trying to go for him

1648
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:37,841
in different places, in different

1649
00:56:37,866 --> 00:56:40,163
spots with different
properties to them.

1650
00:56:40,187 --> 00:56:41,700
Because a lot of spies make the

1651
00:56:41,724 --> 00:56:43,139
mistake of dying to the same

1652
00:56:43,164 --> 00:56:45,288
player in the same place a lot of times,

1653
00:56:45,492 --> 00:56:47,343
and not realizing that it's easy

1654
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:49,199
for that guy to kill them over there.

1655
00:56:49,223 --> 00:56:51,528
Changing the environment in
which you are fighting

1656
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:53,736
is probably on of the more useful things

1657
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,939
you can learn here, and very easily too.

1658
00:56:56,582 --> 00:56:58,370
Sometimes you can even use the fact

1659
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:00,490
that it's easy for someone to shoot you

1660
00:57:00,514 --> 00:57:02,759
in a certain spot that
you already knew about

1661
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:04,460
to use it to your advantage.

1662
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,477
Ok, so this is where all this habit thing

1663
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,926
comes closer to our circlestrafing.

1664
00:57:10,523 --> 00:57:11,606
This demoman is staying

1665
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,949
just outside the other room

1666
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:15,071
in which I am, spamming me

1667
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:16,973
with stickies and projectiles.

1668
00:57:16,997 --> 00:57:18,923
By knowing that he always does this and

1669
00:57:18,948 --> 00:57:20,730
by expecting it, I can make a plan.

1670
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,960
But the real question is how he does it.

1671
00:57:22,984 --> 00:57:25,223
When I come at him, will he let me pass

1672
00:57:25,248 --> 00:57:26,669
or will he back off?

1673
00:57:27,262 --> 00:57:29,478
So again, a player's habit can be anything

1674
00:57:29,503 --> 00:57:31,354
but the more important habits

1675
00:57:31,513 --> 00:57:32,719
that we're going to cover

1676
00:57:32,743 --> 00:57:34,144
here, are going to be habits

1677
00:57:34,168 --> 00:57:35,335
that have something to do

1678
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:36,526
with the player's movement.

1679
00:57:36,943 --> 00:57:38,943
Even if you know a person's level,

1680
00:57:39,007 --> 00:57:40,585
the way he uses his level

1681
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,225
varies from player to player,

1682
00:57:42,249 --> 00:57:44,220
because people can have multiple levels

1683
00:57:44,244 --> 00:57:46,159
and each level by itself has a lot

1684
00:57:46,183 --> 00:57:48,098
of options when it comes to moving.

1685
00:57:48,475 --> 00:57:50,487
Now, with the level of
strafing and everything,

1686
00:57:50,511 --> 00:57:52,535
this tutorial really generalizes.

1687
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,445
But stabbing, dealing with a person

1688
00:57:55,469 --> 00:57:57,469
is about the individual.

1689
00:57:57,494 --> 00:57:58,868
You can't just generalize and

1690
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,957
expect everybody to be the same.

1691
00:58:01,754 --> 00:58:03,066
Let's start it small.

1692
00:58:03,236 --> 00:58:05,648
This guy, I notice that he lets me pass,

1693
00:58:05,672 --> 00:58:07,650
then he strafes at me as we're

1694
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:09,832
in the circle to try to stab.

1695
00:58:09,856 --> 00:58:11,561
Now all of this is just level 4, but

1696
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:13,289
this is very important information.

1697
00:58:13,766 --> 00:58:15,511
The next time we're in the circle,

1698
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:17,507
I already know what he's gonna do.

1699
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:19,242
This is a different guy and he's

1700
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:20,978
on level 4, he lets me pass,

1701
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,139
and when he does he takes a very wide

1702
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:24,670
sideways strafe, so it's hard

1703
00:58:24,694 --> 00:58:26,202
to forwards-and-backwards him.

1704
00:58:26,226 --> 00:58:27,737
So here he lets me pass again, and

1705
00:58:27,762 --> 00:58:30,453
I'm ready to go for an earlier strafe

1706
00:58:30,602 --> 00:58:32,602
to compensate for his sideways strafe.

1707
00:58:32,627 --> 00:58:34,284
Eventually, I figured that this guy

1708
00:58:34,308 --> 00:58:35,965
is used to me moving in only one way,

1709
00:58:35,989 --> 00:58:37,412
so I just can do some of the

1710
00:58:37,436 --> 00:58:39,422
manage-your-matadors techniques on him

1711
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,017
and it works pretty well.

1712
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,458
You see how both of these

1713
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,900
guys who were on level 4,

1714
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:45,289
and yet I still went through a

1715
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,183
different process
when dealing with them

1716
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,778
because they are different.

1717
00:58:49,147 --> 00:58:51,147
Now it's very important to understand a

1718
00:58:51,171 --> 00:58:53,171
player's order of movements.

1719
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:55,712
I know this scout is on 4.1,

1720
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:57,927
but I know that once I
charge at him enough,

1721
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,789
he's going to start trying to outstrafe me

1722
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:01,678
by jumping left and right, giving me

1723
00:59:01,702 --> 00:59:03,566
a second chance for an easier stab.

1724
00:59:03,676 --> 00:59:05,548
Now, I was only able to get that stab

1725
00:59:05,572 --> 00:59:08,051
because I knew exactly
what he was gonna do.

1726
00:59:08,075 --> 00:59:09,881
This scout is also on 4.1,

1727
00:59:09,906 --> 00:59:11,201
but when I charge him,

1728
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:13,571
he jumps over me with level 4.

1729
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:16,185
And whatching him from
afar I didn't know that.

1730
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:18,882
If I did know exactly what he was gonna do

1731
00:59:18,906 --> 00:59:20,894
like with that last scout, I could have

1732
00:59:20,918 --> 00:59:22,906
charged him and gone
backwards right here

1733
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:25,196
and gotten the level 4 stab.

1734
00:59:25,386 --> 00:59:26,496
Then again, you shouldn't

1735
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,630
only learn when you fail.

1736
00:59:28,087 --> 00:59:30,293
This guy is on 4.1, and
when I charge at him

1737
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,317
when we have enough distance between us

1738
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:33,570
he jumps over me.

1739
00:59:33,893 --> 00:59:35,251
Here I glue to him and he has

1740
00:59:35,275 --> 00:59:36,539
no distance so I stab him,

1741
00:59:36,749 --> 00:59:38,088
but I should take note of

1742
00:59:38,113 --> 00:59:39,836
all of this for the next times.

1743
00:59:40,346 --> 00:59:42,011
Now, speaking of order of events,

1744
00:59:42,035 --> 00:59:43,528
you're going to have to understand what a

1745
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,502
player's weapons switching habits are.

1746
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:48,124
Understanding when his levels switch

1747
00:59:48,148 --> 00:59:50,567
and when you should go in for which stab

1748
00:59:50,743 --> 00:59:52,750
is very important while stabbing people

1749
00:59:53,187 --> 00:59:55,672
and especially people who
appear to be random.

1750
00:59:57,162 --> 00:59:58,901
For example this guy, I notice that

1751
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:00,669
after he shoots me with his rockets,

1752
01:00:00,693 --> 01:00:01,991
he switches to his shotgun,

1753
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,609
regardless of me being far

1754
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,228
away from him or anywhere.

1755
01:00:05,252 --> 01:00:07,690
So literally, the next time I see him

1756
01:00:07,913 --> 01:00:10,259
I can have confidence in
getting close to him,

1757
01:00:10,284 --> 01:00:11,303
because I know that he's not

1758
01:00:11,328 --> 01:00:12,902
gonna have that splash damage.

1759
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:14,931
And let's take a look at this pyro.

1760
01:00:15,401 --> 01:00:17,060
He has the habit of pulling out his

1761
01:00:17,085 --> 01:00:19,289
melee after he airblasts me every time.

1762
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:21,591
I get him to miss the blast twice

1763
01:00:21,615 --> 01:00:23,373
and when he pulls out his melee

1764
01:00:23,397 --> 01:00:25,895
he's not on level 1
anymore, he's on level 4.

1765
01:00:26,406 --> 01:00:28,444
And every time he's gonna
see the opportunity to

1766
01:00:28,468 --> 01:00:30,302
pull out his melee. If he does,

1767
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,041
he's going to be on level 4.

1768
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:34,754
Let's have a look at this spy.

1769
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:36,012
He's gonna pull out his gun

1770
01:00:36,036 --> 01:00:37,674
I'm going to try to level 3 him

1771
01:00:37,698 --> 01:00:39,575
and he's not on level 4 on his gun,

1772
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,317
but when I pull out my knife

1773
01:00:41,341 --> 01:00:42,839
he pulls out his to try to

1774
01:00:42,863 --> 01:00:44,653
stab me, or just to be careful.

1775
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:48,557
So I always have to try
for a level 4 stab on him.

1776
01:00:49,466 --> 01:00:50,293
Moving on.

1777
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,317
Now this guy knows what I'm doing,

1778
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:53,864
whenever I run at him to try

1779
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,411
to get a level 3 stab on him

1780
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:56,826
he lets me pass.

1781
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:58,719
But he doesn't always do it, only

1782
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,878
when he's sure I'm going for the stab.

1783
01:01:01,068 --> 01:01:03,453
Meaning that he goes for it very late.

1784
01:01:03,649 --> 01:01:06,956
I can't get a level 3 or 4
stab on him normally,

1785
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,565
so I have to really push my face into him

1786
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:11,255
to make him believe that

1787
01:01:11,279 --> 01:01:12,982
I'm going for a level 3 stab.

1788
01:01:13,418 --> 01:01:16,165
Now, that guy was extremely
difficult to handle.

1789
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,355
But there can be habits

1790
01:01:17,379 --> 01:01:18,748
who make it easier for you.

1791
01:01:18,772 --> 01:01:20,373
Now, this guy is juking and

1792
01:01:20,397 --> 01:01:21,998
we've already seen him before.

1793
01:01:22,022 --> 01:01:24,847
He's on level 4 on his gun, so usually

1794
01:01:24,871 --> 01:01:26,542
even if I managed to get close to

1795
01:01:26,567 --> 01:01:28,799
his jukes, he would let me pass.

1796
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:30,767
But just like those last two spies,

1797
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,791
when I pull out my knife, he pulls his.

1798
01:01:32,996 --> 01:01:34,662
And with his knife, he tries

1799
01:01:34,686 --> 01:01:36,352
to go for a level 3 matador,

1800
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:38,568
meaning that his jukes are almost always

1801
01:01:38,593 --> 01:01:41,577
going to get extended
into longer strafes,

1802
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:44,187
which makes things really easy for me.

1803
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:45,807
Now, this guy is no different from

1804
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,067
those last spies who were being careful,

1805
01:01:48,092 --> 01:01:49,484
it's just that his level with

1806
01:01:49,508 --> 01:01:50,900
the knife in this situation

1807
01:01:50,924 --> 01:01:53,683
cancels out the rest
of his better movements.

1808
01:01:53,859 --> 01:01:55,224
Also, after he's done with his

1809
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:56,779
knife and takes out his gun again,

1810
01:01:56,803 --> 01:01:59,743
his strafes stay long and not jukes.

1811
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:02,298
For a couple of seconds, he keeps trying

1812
01:02:02,322 --> 01:02:04,322
to outstrafe me, with the gun this time.

1813
01:02:04,492 --> 01:02:05,635
And see, knowing all of

1814
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,463
this works in my advantage.

1815
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:08,837
Obviously, this is the kind

1816
01:02:08,861 --> 01:02:10,079
of habit you can just stop

1817
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,250
once you figure out it's
messing you up, but

1818
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,864
maybe not as quickly as you'd expect.

1819
01:02:17,114 --> 01:02:18,856
Ok so, habit is something

1820
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,623
that is unique to a player

1821
01:02:20,886 --> 01:02:22,638
and it could be literally anything,

1822
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:25,541
like not wanting to drop
down from that ledge.

1823
01:02:25,692 --> 01:02:27,436
When a habit comes closer to having

1824
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,619
something to do with a player's movements,

1825
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,180
it's harder for him to change it.

1826
01:02:31,204 --> 01:02:33,125
And when it comes to the essence of

1827
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,071
his movements, his reflex, his level

1828
01:02:35,494 --> 01:02:36,652
then he can't change it.

1829
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:41,291
Ok, so let's put it all
together, let's take

1830
01:02:41,316 --> 01:02:43,786
a look at some interesting players I found.

1831
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:45,836
This engie is on level 3, I can pretty

1832
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,217
much see immediately when I first see him.

1833
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:50,279
The next time I see him, he does it

1834
01:02:50,303 --> 01:02:52,342
with a little more backwards strafes

1835
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:53,469
they're a little turned,

1836
01:02:53,494 --> 01:02:55,511
but not enough to be on 4.1.

1837
01:02:55,821 --> 01:02:57,192
Here we're in a tight area and he

1838
01:02:57,216 --> 01:02:58,649
can't really strafe left and right,

1839
01:02:58,674 --> 01:02:59,763
but he does manage to keep

1840
01:02:59,787 --> 01:03:00,877
the strafe turned enough

1841
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:02,879
in order to not get backpedal stabbed.

1842
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:05,263
But eventually, he gets trapped,

1843
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:06,502
and pulls out his melee

1844
01:03:06,526 --> 01:03:08,264
once he runs out of shells.

1845
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,288
And I can see that he keeps doing it

1846
01:03:10,312 --> 01:03:11,794
every time he runs out of shells,

1847
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:13,523
so I can just sort of count them

1848
01:03:13,547 --> 01:03:14,857
and figure out the timing

1849
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:15,978
to expect his melee.

1850
01:03:16,289 --> 01:03:18,981
Now, he has a very accurate level 1 melee,

1851
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:20,579
which means he just doesn't fly

1852
01:03:20,603 --> 01:03:22,178
at me every time he pulls it out.

1853
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,782
He stays on me, but this actually helps us.

1854
01:03:26,852 --> 01:03:28,831
Let's talk corners. This guy, this

1855
01:03:28,856 --> 01:03:30,046
is the first time I'm seeing him

1856
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,048
I have no idea what he's gonna do,

1857
01:03:32,072 --> 01:03:34,072
but I still kinda want to try to stab him.

1858
01:03:34,096 --> 01:03:35,338
So there's a corner coming up,

1859
01:03:35,643 --> 01:03:37,999
 I'm going to bet on him taking it wide

1860
01:03:38,024 --> 01:03:39,911
and he does, but much wider

1861
01:03:39,936 --> 01:03:41,077
than what I thought he would.

1862
01:03:41,114 --> 01:03:44,300
So at this point I see 3
possibilities in my head.

1863
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:46,903
The first one is that he's on 4.2,

1864
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:48,221
and this is why he was able

1865
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:49,539
to take a strafe this wide.

1866
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:52,121
The second option is that, on the outside,

1867
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:54,218
he won't be able to
take a strafe this wide

1868
01:03:54,242 --> 01:03:56,265
without the corner guiding him to do so,

1869
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,760
and he's just on level 4.

1870
01:03:57,997 --> 01:03:59,455
The third option is that he does

1871
01:03:59,479 --> 01:04:00,937
something completely different

1872
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,961
and just happens to take corners wide.

1873
01:04:02,997 --> 01:04:05,842
Well, as it turns out, he's just a level 4,

1874
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:07,400
and I was able to keep stabbing

1875
01:04:07,424 --> 01:04:08,958
him like that for the entire game.

1876
01:04:08,982 --> 01:04:11,481
But that's the thing,
all of these possibilities,

1877
01:04:11,505 --> 01:04:13,803
all of these thoughts, should go through

1878
01:04:13,828 --> 01:04:16,792
my head with every
single step he makes.

1879
01:04:17,016 --> 01:04:18,560
The more a player stays on the

1880
01:04:18,585 --> 01:04:20,130
server, the more you meet him

1881
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,578
the more you should be able

1882
01:04:21,602 --> 01:04:23,226
to understand what he's doing.

1883
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,045
Here I don't know
anything, but I do see

1884
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,143
that he's trying to get
around me by jumping

1885
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,791
while we're up on that tight spot.

1886
01:04:28,815 --> 01:04:30,034
So well, after fighting him

1887
01:04:30,058 --> 01:04:31,460
on the ground a little bit

1888
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:33,209
I figured that he's on 4.1.

1889
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,231
And a very unique one at that.

1890
01:04:35,474 --> 01:04:37,300
I can't just glue to him normally,

1891
01:04:37,324 --> 01:04:39,108
I have to leave him some space

1892
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:41,312
in order for the stab to succeed.

1893
01:04:41,405 --> 01:04:42,885
Now, he can't really think about it,

1894
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:45,354
it's just how the specifics
of his movements work.

1895
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:47,306
Now, because it's so much harder,

1896
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,985
I look for other ways to stab him.

1897
01:04:49,009 --> 01:04:50,927
Let's take a look at how
he takes corners now.

1898
01:04:50,952 --> 01:04:52,322
He takes it wide... oh he double

1899
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:53,716
jumps while he takes them wide.

1900
01:04:54,213 --> 01:04:54,858
Ok.

1901
01:04:55,593 --> 01:04:57,059
Now, if I charge at him enough

1902
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:58,100
and leave him no space,

1903
01:04:58,125 --> 01:04:59,402
if I put him in a tight spot,

1904
01:04:59,426 --> 01:05:01,242
is he going to double jump over me?

1905
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:02,752
Well, I know from previous

1906
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:04,253
times he sometimes does it,

1907
01:05:04,743 --> 01:05:06,229
and yes, he does it here too.

1908
01:05:06,439 --> 01:05:08,811
I'm slowly learning how to deal with him.

1909
01:05:09,561 --> 01:05:11,561
The more I meet with him,
the more I look at him,

1910
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:13,325
the more these kinds of things

1911
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:14,804
will become less instinctive,

1912
01:05:14,987 --> 01:05:17,366
and more like solid facts you can think

1913
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,769
about before even starting to fight him.

1914
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,684
Let's take a look at this pyro.

1915
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,980
We already know him, he's on 4.3,

1916
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,491
but when he stops chasing me

1917
01:05:25,515 --> 01:05:27,003
and pulls out his flare gun,

1918
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:28,437
he's just on level 4.

1919
01:05:28,461 --> 01:05:29,926
Like this, he mostly falls for the

1920
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,414
manage-your-matadors techniques.

1921
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,823
He also takes wide corners and uses

1922
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,992
stairs and slopes to jump over you.

1923
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:38,774
But I've noticed that
what he enjoys even more

1924
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:40,289
is setting me on fire

1925
01:05:40,314 --> 01:05:41,791
and then going behind the corner

1926
01:05:41,815 --> 01:05:43,815
just to come right back
and try to flare me.

1927
01:05:44,118 --> 01:05:45,639
This is a habit of his that I

1928
01:05:45,663 --> 01:05:47,183
can see him doing on every map.

1929
01:05:47,793 --> 01:05:49,105
He flames me, he goes behind the

1930
01:05:49,129 --> 01:05:50,646
corner, he comes back with the flare.

1931
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,916
This is a habit he is
extremely accustomed to

1932
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,045
because it has a lot to
do with his movements.

1933
01:05:56,069 --> 01:05:58,069
Even if he backs up into some corner

1934
01:05:58,093 --> 01:05:59,617
because it's dangerous, come close

1935
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:01,631
enough to him, he's gonna come right back,

1936
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:02,899
and go around me.

1937
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:04,689
I've also noticed that he's one of

1938
01:06:04,713 --> 01:06:06,549
those pyros who punch you with the flare,

1939
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:08,699
and then just hope to walk away.

1940
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,619
Sometimes pyros do this and hope

1941
01:06:10,643 --> 01:06:11,974
for you to just burn to death

1942
01:06:11,998 --> 01:06:13,299
and sometimes I'm gonna be

1943
01:06:13,323 --> 01:06:14,917
able to use this to my advantage.

1944
01:06:15,328 --> 01:06:17,155
In addition, I can see that this

1945
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:18,834
guy doesn't trust his flames

1946
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,558
he's always always just gonna

1947
01:06:20,582 --> 01:06:22,459
try to walk around and flare me.

1948
01:06:22,568 --> 01:06:24,543
This means that after he catches up

1949
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:26,542
to me with 4.3 and lights me on fire,

1950
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:29,278
he's gonna airblast and then
just keep his flare out

1951
01:06:29,302 --> 01:06:31,914
until he punches me, and
then he'll walk away,

1952
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,271
which I can see is leaving him

1953
01:06:34,295 --> 01:06:36,125
vulnerable to the level 4 stabs

1954
01:06:36,149 --> 01:06:37,753
while he's with the flare out.

1955
01:06:38,064 --> 01:06:40,064
So maybe I should just aim for that.

1956
01:06:40,314 --> 01:06:41,357
But moving on.

1957
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:42,485
Let's take a look at this

1958
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:44,020
same guy when he goes scout.

1959
01:06:44,273 --> 01:06:45,328
Well, I can see that he's

1960
01:06:45,353 --> 01:06:46,656
still taking corners wide,

1961
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,085
but other than that, we've

1962
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:49,572
already seen this scout before

1963
01:06:49,596 --> 01:06:51,792
and he's on 4.1, not to mention

1964
01:06:51,816 --> 01:06:53,656
he seems to be juking now,

1965
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:55,464
which is very very different

1966
01:06:55,488 --> 01:06:56,832
from when he went pyro.

1967
01:06:56,856 --> 01:06:58,801
So how do I even start to...? Wow!

1968
01:06:58,878 --> 01:07:00,207
Ok apparently...

1969
01:07:00,362 --> 01:07:01,844
What happened there? Suddenly he had

1970
01:07:01,869 --> 01:07:03,539
long sideways strafes,

1971
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:06,902
that doesn't sound like
juking or 4.1 at all.

1972
01:07:07,186 --> 01:07:09,897
So let's start digging into
this guy, I guess.

1973
01:07:09,922 --> 01:07:10,885
Try for forwards and

1974
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:12,408
backwards, but it doesn't work.

1975
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:14,432
Go for a glue stab and it does work.

1976
01:07:14,456 --> 01:07:16,639
But I noticed that he kept juking

1977
01:07:16,773 --> 01:07:19,368
on my side there, and while backing off.

1978
01:07:19,392 --> 01:07:20,883
This, this is interesting.

1979
01:07:21,014 --> 01:07:23,145
After a while, I realized that this guy

1980
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:24,507
goes to my side and backs

1981
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:26,328
off like good 4.1s do,

1982
01:07:26,511 --> 01:07:29,185
but he's also juking while he's at my side.

1983
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,927
He stays at my side and he jukes

1984
01:07:32,158 --> 01:07:34,523
and he backs off when he feels like it.

1985
01:07:34,753 --> 01:07:36,472
Ok, so let's have another go at him,

1986
01:07:36,496 --> 01:07:38,727
he goes to my side, starts juking...

1987
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:40,910
Just as we expected.

1988
01:07:41,347 --> 01:07:42,692
But then again, wait a second,

1989
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:44,553
at the beginning there, here, I try

1990
01:07:44,578 --> 01:07:46,609
for a glue stab and he let me pass.

1991
01:07:47,851 --> 01:07:49,378
Well, after a while I figured

1992
01:07:49,402 --> 01:07:51,140
that the first moment he sees me,

1993
01:07:51,524 --> 01:07:53,716
he tries to go around me, lets me pass,

1994
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,291
for the first step over there,

1995
01:07:55,315 --> 01:07:56,819
before the fight begins.

1996
01:07:56,844 --> 01:07:58,172
So now I can expect it.

1997
01:07:59,362 --> 01:08:01,003
Ok so he lets me pass,

1998
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:04,213
then he starts juking around
and going for a 4.1,

1999
01:08:04,237 --> 01:08:05,775
but what after that?

2000
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:07,396
Here, he let me pass again and then

2001
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:09,753
he started having longer strafes,

2002
01:08:09,777 --> 01:08:11,587
just like that first stab on him.

2003
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,837
Well apparently, if my glue stab fails,

2004
01:08:15,101 --> 01:08:17,101
that means he sees my sides

2005
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,525
and it gives him the idea

2006
01:08:18,549 --> 01:08:19,949
to start outstrafing me.

2007
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,511
See, whenever he sees my

2008
01:08:21,535 --> 01:08:23,078
sides, whenever he's behind me

2009
01:08:23,102 --> 01:08:25,614
he starts having long
left and right strafes

2010
01:08:25,638 --> 01:08:27,423
to try and stay behind me

2011
01:08:27,573 --> 01:08:28,944
for when I turn around.

2012
01:08:29,874 --> 01:08:31,269
What happened back in that first

2013
01:08:31,293 --> 01:08:32,555
time must have been related.

2014
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:35,124
He was juking at me from
the sides, like he does

2015
01:08:35,148 --> 01:08:36,669
and when he saw it doesn't work

2016
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:38,214
and that I keep coming at him,

2017
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,443
he started trying to
outstrafe me differently.

2018
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,815
So I figured out a whole bunch of things

2019
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:44,827
about this guy and his order of events.

2020
01:08:44,851 --> 01:08:46,710
He lets me pass, then he jukes

2021
01:08:46,734 --> 01:08:48,344
me from the side with 4.1,

2022
01:08:48,368 --> 01:08:50,527
and if that doesn't work,
he lets me pass again

2023
01:08:50,551 --> 01:08:53,249
and keeps his long strafe
to try to outstrafe me

2024
01:08:53,526 --> 01:08:54,997
with 3/4.

2025
01:08:56,107 --> 01:08:57,607
Moving up a little bit, let's take a

2026
01:08:57,631 --> 01:08:59,435
look at this pyro that
we've seen before,

2027
01:08:59,459 --> 01:09:01,082
he's on 4.2.

2028
01:09:01,485 --> 01:09:03,485
And when I go forwards
and backwards on him,

2029
01:09:03,628 --> 01:09:05,069
he always takes a very wide

2030
01:09:05,093 --> 01:09:07,003
sideways strafe
and I can't get him.

2031
01:09:07,028 --> 01:09:09,316
I figured that I can't
get him unless I make

2032
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,627
it look like I'm going for a level 1 stab,

2033
01:09:11,651 --> 01:09:13,651
only to change at the last moment.

2034
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:16,952
Here, I also figured out a
certain spot with him.

2035
01:09:17,242 --> 01:09:18,467
I think that he's gonna strafe

2036
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:20,810
across the wall,
like level 4s do, but

2037
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:23,222
he goes from the other side in order to

2038
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:25,401
enbox me between the wall and himself

2039
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:26,962
so he can shoot me down.

2040
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,403
So for the next time when

2041
01:09:28,427 --> 01:09:29,752
I see him I already know

2042
01:09:29,776 --> 01:09:31,701
that he's gonna drop
down from that staircase.

2043
01:09:31,725 --> 01:09:33,399
Here I'm headed towards the wall,

2044
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:35,097
he sees the opportunity to enbox me

2045
01:09:35,387 --> 01:09:37,593
and if kind of looked like a level 1 stab.

2046
01:09:37,618 --> 01:09:39,395
But this guy is not on level 1.

2047
01:09:39,419 --> 01:09:41,991
I just knew exactly what I
was doing against him.

2048
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:44,807
Here it looks like a freaking
matador already.

2049
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,162
But it's not, there's thought behind this.

2050
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:49,251
Without trying to figure out this stuff,

2051
01:09:49,276 --> 01:09:51,481
without, at every turn
 trying to understand

2052
01:09:51,505 --> 01:09:53,505
"what did I get?", "what did I not get?",

2053
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:55,785
I'll only rarely be able to get him.

2054
01:09:56,709 --> 01:09:58,336
Now, the higher the skill level of

2055
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,988
the players you're facing becomes,

2056
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,605
the more you understand
that they're all juking,

2057
01:10:02,655 --> 01:10:04,180
they're all in 4.3,

2058
01:10:04,383 --> 01:10:05,808
and they're all on 4.1.

2059
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:07,469
Now, without knowing this,

2060
01:10:07,493 --> 01:10:10,479
you can't even begin to
deal with that player.

2061
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:12,547
For example, here he cuts the corner

2062
01:10:12,571 --> 01:10:14,356
while I'm going for a cornerstab,

2063
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,191
here I'm going for a level 1 stab

2064
01:10:16,215 --> 01:10:18,420
when I should have gone
for glue, had I known it.

2065
01:10:18,577 --> 01:10:21,450
Here, he gets insanely far
away from me with 4.1,

2066
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,332
which makes me think I can get away,

2067
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:25,196
but then he comes extremely close to

2068
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,596
me with 4.3 and jumping over the rock.

2069
01:10:27,886 --> 01:10:29,247
But see, even knowing that

2070
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:30,633
he has all these levels

2071
01:10:30,657 --> 01:10:32,308
will sometimes not help you that much.

2072
01:10:32,332 --> 01:10:34,350
This guy is on the aforementioned levels,

2073
01:10:34,785 --> 01:10:36,899
I get him with a 4.3 stab over here.

2074
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:38,616
Here I try to go for it again,

2075
01:10:38,787 --> 01:10:40,701
 but this time he doesn't do it.

2076
01:10:40,947 --> 01:10:42,491
I could've died here, I didn't know

2077
01:10:42,516 --> 01:10:44,507
when he wasn't
vulnerable to the stab

2078
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:45,635
and when he is.

2079
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:46,974
As it turns out,

2080
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:50,185
he only cuts corners when
I'm very far away.

2081
01:10:50,481 --> 01:10:52,835
I have to check how he uses those levels,

2082
01:10:52,859 --> 01:10:55,084
where does he do, and what and how.

2083
01:10:55,421 --> 01:10:58,407
4.3 if I stay far away
enough and shoot him,

2084
01:10:59,138 --> 01:11:00,382
can I get it easily?

2085
01:11:01,118 --> 01:11:03,325
Then again he doesn't
really do it that much,

2086
01:11:03,349 --> 01:11:05,349
and I can't just randomly run at him

2087
01:11:05,373 --> 01:11:07,373
and expect to outstrafe his 4.1.

2088
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:10,259
This doesn't really happen at all.

2089
01:11:10,283 --> 01:11:12,283
I don't wanna deal with his 4.1 strafe.

2090
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:15,397
So ok, I also know that
he's on level 3, right?

2091
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:16,610
And I do know that he waits

2092
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:18,001
for me behind a corner with it

2093
01:11:18,036 --> 01:11:19,257
when he thinks I'm going for

2094
01:11:19,281 --> 01:11:20,502
a cornerstab or something.

2095
01:11:20,633 --> 01:11:23,499
So level 3 is something I
wanna deal with, right?

2096
01:11:23,523 --> 01:11:25,027
as opposed to his other levels.

2097
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:26,589
So here he does it again,

2098
01:11:26,839 --> 01:11:28,267
when it looked like
I was going for

2099
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:29,719
a cornerstab there for a second.

2100
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,633
So here he chases me into this tunnel

2101
01:11:31,657 --> 01:11:35,050
and here there's not gonna
be any 4.3, only 4.1.

2102
01:11:35,074 --> 01:11:36,812
And I see that so I forced him

2103
01:11:36,836 --> 01:11:38,574
to fly all the way back there.

2104
01:11:38,598 --> 01:11:40,353
And force him to realize that there's

2105
01:11:40,377 --> 01:11:42,083
no place to back up into anymore,

2106
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,699
there's only level 3.

2107
01:11:44,795 --> 01:11:47,983
So I can force him into
level 3 as a last resort,

2108
01:11:48,007 --> 01:11:49,698
but out in the open like this, I

2109
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,680
can't expect to get a stab like that

2110
01:11:51,705 --> 01:11:53,042
every time, come on.

2111
01:11:53,066 --> 01:11:54,677
I mean, this one was kinda lucky,

2112
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:56,701
but here he's gonna be
with his shotgun again,

2113
01:11:57,258 --> 01:11:58,647
he's gonna go 4.1.

2114
01:11:58,983 --> 01:12:00,177
But I noticed he let me

2115
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:01,657
pass here for just a second

2116
01:12:01,682 --> 01:12:03,292
and I get another lucky stab on him,

2117
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:05,316
because he got stuck on the planks there.

2118
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:07,102
But for my next times I know,

2119
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:09,126
if he's not juking with the shotgun,

2120
01:12:09,236 --> 01:12:11,236
then I charge at him and get close enough

2121
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,800
he's gonna let me pass

2122
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:16,592
which leads to me even
getting a stab like this.

2123
01:12:16,787 --> 01:12:18,506
See, without at any point

2124
01:12:18,531 --> 01:12:20,062
and across different games,

2125
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,086
if I don't make the most I can

2126
01:12:22,243 --> 01:12:24,243
out of every single encounter with him

2127
01:12:24,267 --> 01:12:26,962
every time I see him stepping some place,

2128
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:28,614
I'm really only rarely going

2129
01:12:28,638 --> 01:12:29,918
to be able to stab him.

2130
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:31,806
I'll get a lucky 4.3 here,

2131
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:33,569
a lucky level 3 over there, and...

2132
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:36,198
Well, that'll be it,

2133
01:12:36,615 --> 01:12:39,122
because I won't know how to repeat them.

2134
01:12:39,645 --> 01:12:41,523
But you know, assuming I did,

2135
01:12:42,008 --> 01:12:44,008
and assuming that I know these things,

2136
01:12:44,405 --> 01:12:45,902
this also means that I can tell

2137
01:12:45,926 --> 01:12:47,423
what I know about these players

2138
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,998
to my other friends who
may play against them.

2139
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,021
Now, what if I told you

2140
01:12:52,045 --> 01:12:54,336
that I met a player who's on level 3

2141
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,778
and he has fast strafes.

2142
01:12:55,802 --> 01:12:57,419
But whenever I try to stab him,

2143
01:12:57,443 --> 01:12:59,061
he lets me pass with level 4,

2144
01:12:59,085 --> 01:13:00,529
so he's on 3/4.

2145
01:13:00,553 --> 01:13:01,857
But he never tries to outstrafe

2146
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:03,172
me with it out in the open.

2147
01:13:03,196 --> 01:13:04,817
He always backs away from corners,

2148
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:06,462
but when I chase him into a corner,

2149
01:13:06,486 --> 01:13:08,424
he always comes back with his melee,

2150
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:09,596
so he's sort of trying to

2151
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,999
cornerstab you, which is cute.

2152
01:13:11,023 --> 01:13:12,042
Whenever I catch him by

2153
01:13:12,066 --> 01:13:13,489
surprise he always lets me pass

2154
01:13:13,513 --> 01:13:16,111
by reflex, which compliments his level 4.

2155
01:13:16,361 --> 01:13:17,986
And whenever I go up the stairs,

2156
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:20,149
he stays at the bottom and shoots.

2157
01:13:20,965 --> 01:13:22,965
Wait did I mention he was a scout?

2158
01:13:23,434 --> 01:13:25,154
Now, I didn't show you
any footage because

2159
01:13:25,178 --> 01:13:26,675
you were already supposed to see it,

2160
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,791
see a picture of it for yourselves.

2161
01:13:28,848 --> 01:13:30,852
And then inside of your
heads you could think

2162
01:13:30,876 --> 01:13:32,835
about when and where
you'll meet this guy

2163
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:34,203
and how you should deal with him.

2164
01:13:34,227 --> 01:13:35,974
You could make a very specific

2165
01:13:35,998 --> 01:13:37,746
plan before even meeting him.

2166
01:13:38,616 --> 01:13:41,103
Also, I didn't show you
because he's not real.

2167
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:44,319
Being able to sort out
information like this

2168
01:13:44,343 --> 01:13:47,096
is the grand point of all of these videos.

2169
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,666
Communications between spies about

2170
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:52,181
movement has always
been a little glitchy,

2171
01:13:52,205 --> 01:13:55,357
beyond saying things like
stairstab or cornerstab

2172
01:13:55,381 --> 01:13:57,092
nobody can understand each other.

2173
01:13:57,116 --> 01:13:59,681
And this is the main point
of all of these videos,

2174
01:13:59,705 --> 01:14:01,705
to create this new terminology,

2175
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:03,729
this whole new dictionary.

2176
01:14:03,753 --> 01:14:06,235
You can take every single thing you see

2177
01:14:06,259 --> 01:14:08,259
and put it into a certain category.

2178
01:14:08,283 --> 01:14:09,658
Then you'll be able to simply

2179
01:14:09,683 --> 01:14:11,160
open up this dictionary,

2180
01:14:11,296 --> 01:14:13,796
extract what you want, and communicate it

2181
01:14:13,957 --> 01:14:15,077
to somebody else.

2182
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:16,632
I'm hoping that this way

2183
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:18,293
we could share information

2184
01:14:18,524 --> 01:14:20,033
through words and text while

2185
01:14:20,057 --> 01:14:21,403
playing with each other.

2186
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:25,747
Well, finally.

2187
01:14:26,371 --> 01:14:27,709
It's time to wrap this up.

2188
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,611
I hate to say it, but when you get

2189
01:14:30,635 --> 01:14:32,281
out there, your first attempts

2190
01:14:32,338 --> 01:14:34,116
will not go the way you planned.

2191
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:36,319
This is the reality of practice,

2192
01:14:36,343 --> 01:14:37,886
practising something new.

2193
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:40,282
But eventually, after some practice,

2194
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:41,670
there will come a player,

2195
01:14:41,921 --> 01:14:43,719
a player that won't fall
for your trickstabs

2196
01:14:43,743 --> 01:14:45,426
and can't fall for your matadors,

2197
01:14:45,712 --> 01:14:47,436
and this will be your answer to him.

2198
01:14:47,871 --> 01:14:49,733
A lot of things, and especially when

2199
01:14:49,758 --> 01:14:51,240
you're just learning
and not used to it,

2200
01:14:51,271 --> 01:14:53,028
a lot of things will throw you off.

2201
01:14:53,053 --> 01:14:54,790
A lot of things will not make sense,

2202
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:55,878
 and you will fail a lot.

2203
01:14:55,902 --> 01:14:57,973
But those moments are also important.

2204
01:14:58,303 --> 01:15:01,009
Experimenting by yourself, out there,

2205
01:15:01,033 --> 01:15:03,033
leads to better understanding of movement.

2206
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:06,341
Spy is not only about keen
intuition and instinct,

2207
01:15:06,365 --> 01:15:08,476
as a spy you're a
forward thinker, you're

2208
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,612
supposed to have
information in your head

2209
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,048
before you run into a situation.

2210
01:15:13,278 --> 01:15:15,278
And I think that everybody
should play this game

2211
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,302
while having this eye for movement,

2212
01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:19,922
because I found that
particularly in this game,

2213
01:15:20,124 --> 01:15:22,541
everything revolves around movement.

2214
01:15:22,927 --> 01:15:23,959
I believe that everything

2215
01:15:23,984 --> 01:15:26,141
learnt here can be and should be

2216
01:15:26,165 --> 01:15:27,696
a part of every playstyle

2217
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,251
and of every player's game.

2218
01:15:29,368 --> 01:15:31,867
And not just for stabbing
and not just for spies.

2219
01:15:31,971 --> 01:15:33,675
Sitting from the side and being able

2220
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,811
to collect information about movement

2221
01:15:35,835 --> 01:15:37,906
like this is something that I

2222
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:40,002
think every player should know.

2223
01:15:40,363 --> 01:15:41,610
Though I really hope that this

2224
01:15:41,635 --> 01:15:43,512
tutorial will help
you to graduate

2225
01:15:43,536 --> 01:15:45,536
from these kinds of things,

2226
01:15:45,766 --> 01:15:46,902
and to just start going for

2227
01:15:46,926 --> 01:15:48,063
things with a little more

2228
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:49,351
thought behind them.

2229
01:15:50,148 --> 01:15:51,900
I would like to thank everybody,

2230
01:15:51,924 --> 01:15:53,595
everybody who watched this far.

2231
01:15:53,619 --> 01:15:56,211
A huge thanks to everybody
who stayed with me

2232
01:15:56,235 --> 01:15:57,706
in the late hours of the night

2233
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:00,522
helping me to get examples,
I'm in debt to you.

2234
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:03,079
And this is everything
you guys, this is it.

2235
01:16:03,349 --> 01:16:05,474
Thank you guys, thank you so much.

2236
01:16:05,618 --> 01:16:06,916
I want you to take care,

2237
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,478
and just for me, and only if you want to,

2238
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:13,295
I want you to
KEEP ON SPYING
